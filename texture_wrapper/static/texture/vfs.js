Texture is open source software built on top of Substance (http://substance.io), an advanced Javascript content authoring library. While the Substance library is format agnostic, the Texture editor uses JATS XML as a native exchange format. The Substance library that Texture is built on already supports real-time collaborative authoring, and the easy-to-use WYSIWYG interface would make Texture an attractive alternative to Google Docs. For some editors, the interface could be toggled to more closely resemble a professional XML suite, allowing a user to pop out a raw attribute editor for any given element. Texture-authored documents could then be brought into the journal management system directly, skipping the conversion step, and move straight into a document-centric publishing workflow.</p>\n      </abstract>\n      <trans-abstract xml:lang=\"de\">\n        <p></p>\n      </trans-abstract>\n    </article-meta>\n  </front>\n  <body>\n    <!-- We use HTML-style headings instead of sections in the Texture format -->\n    <sec>\n      <title>Introduction</title>\n      <p><italic>Microsoft Word</italic>'s dominance as an authoring tool creates substantial inefficiencies in the scholarly authoring ecosystem. Many journals and journal management platforms are designed around uploading and downloading incrementally updated drafts of Word manuscripts, creating a difficult-to-manage ecosystem of individual change-tracked files and annotated PDFs. For most end users, there is no sufficiently easy to use or widely accepted alternative to this; although some researchers author in LaTeX or Markdown which can at least be <italic>diff</italic>ed line by line, getting most authors away from Word has been a fairly fruitless task so far. We believe that this is mostly due to ease of use. Yet, when it comes to publishing, the scholarly publishing industry has (mostly) settled on a structured format&#x2014;JATS XML. This disconnect between the tools and formats used for authoring and the formats required for publishing has meant that, for several decades now, manuscripts received from authors will need to be entirely XML-typeset by publishers at considerable expense (<xref rid=\"R1\" ref-type=\"bibr\" id=\"IDad51a777-cce8-4561-9608-aa93daf279d1\">Eve, 2016</xref>). </p>\n      <p>The role of the XML typesetting is so crucial that there are several companies that specialize in just this task. Right now, most academic journals with adequate budgets have outstanding contracts with third-party typesetting shops, resulting in a process that is highly professionalized, but also highly impractical and unavailable to many smaller journals. This work, requiring specialized labour and more person-hours than can be easily justified, has been one of the main differentiating factors between well-resourced journals and those on shoestring budgets. This is especially unfortunate, as having an XML-first workflow that allows journals to produce multiple formats from a single source would be especially beneficial to such low-budget journals. </p>\n      <p>Efforts to bring XML markup, in particular JATS, to a broader group of journals have continued to appear in recent years. These efforts, in the form of automatic Word-to-XML converters include the Public Knowledge Project&#x2019;s Open Typsetting Stack (<xref rid=\"R2\" ref-type=\"bibr\" id=\"ID4a404789-267a-463a-858b-cb40a9332576\">Garnett, Alperin &amp; Willinsky, 2015</xref>), Martin Eve&#x2019;s meTypeset (<xref rid=\"R3\" ref-type=\"bibr\" id=\"ID80649f36-cf19-474c-8e6d-9f5ac62486dd\">Eve, 2015</xref>) redalyc.org&#x2019;s Marcalyc (<ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://marcalyc.redalyc.org/\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:type=\"simple\">http://marcalyc.redalyc.org/</ext-link>) However, none of these tools, and, to the best of our knowledge, none of the proprietary tools used by those offering professional XML markup services, produce production-quality JATS without user mediation, and still require manual or semi-manual intervention. From the perspective of publishers who are currently not producing JATS, this last step requires having XML expertise on hand, or the resources to acquire them. </p>\n    </sec>\n    <sec>\n      <title>Introducing Texture</title>\n      <p>Texture is a WYSIWYG editor app that allows users to turn raw content into structured content, and add as much semantic information as needed for the production of scientific publications. The primary goal of Texture is to remove this requirement for XML expertise by providing a solution for publishers to bring accepted papers to production more efficiently.</p>\n      <p>Texture reads and produces valid JATS files. This allows Texture to work seamlessly in existing publishing workflows. For instance, Texture can take the output of a Word to JATS converter and enhance the content until it is ready to be published, integrating into current toolchains. Texture produces normalized JATS, applying a nearly<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"bibd2e86\"/> lossless conversion and following strict rules and best practices (JATS4R).</p>\n      <p>With Texture, we propose an <bold>iterative refinement</bold> process. Starting from the best available output from a <bold>automated conversion process</bold>, different steps are taken to turn the article into a structured, semantically tagged article, augmented with metadata. For example, the author of a document could be represented as plaintext under the title. As a refinement, this piece of text can be tagged as <italic>author</italic>. On the next level, this can be replaced by a structured version, with &lt;family-name&gt;, &lt;given-name&gt;, etc, and even more metadata such as an ORCID, for instance. The same would be true for citations. Similarly, references can be initially tagged as <italic>mixed citations, </italic>but at a later stage, Texture can connect to third party APIs (e.g. DataCite, CrossRef) and convert them into fully structured element citations.</p>\n      <sec>\n        <title level=\"2\">Current state of development</title>\n        <p>Texture is open source software built on top of <italic>Substance</italic> (http://substance.io), an advanced Javascript content authoring library. While the Substance library is format agnostic, the Texture editor uses JATS XML as a native exchange format.</p>\n        <p>Texture ships with a fairly complete set of document elements already implemented in the user interface, including support for tables (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"table1\"/>), figures (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1 fig2\"/>), citations, equations, and so on. Rendering of each of these elements is implemented on a modular basis, so that any supported JATS element can be added as a local customization and merged back into the upstream codebase. As-yet unimplemented elements can still be added or edited by an end user in raw XML as needed.</p>\n        <fig id=\"fig1\">\n          <caption>\n            <title>Behavioural design and implantation details.</title>\n            <p>Example figure taken from <ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15278\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Schaffelhofer, Scherberger 2016</ext-link>.</p>\n          </caption>\n          <graphic mime-subtype=\"jpeg\" mimetype=\"image\" xlink:href=\"/static/texture/assets/fig1.jpg\"/>\n        </fig>\n        <p>With Texture, editors can use an interface similar to a classic word processor. This makes the difficult job of manually crafting XML (such as in the <italic>Oxygen</italic> software) unnecessary for most workflows and provides a more natural approach to content curation. The user interface can be extended to reflect specialized viewing modes; Texture can be customized for different user roles to provide different levels of complexity. For some editors, the interface could be toggled to more closely resemble a professional XML suite, allowing a user to pop out a raw attribute editor for any given element. </p>\n        <p>Texture is designed to be embeddable. It provides a set of components that can be configured to fit different integration scenarios. For example, Texture will be soon available as a stand-alone desktop application (using <ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://electron.atom.io/\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Electron</ext-link>), ready to read and write JATS XML files from local filesystems. In contrast, Open Journal Systems (OJS) will integrate Texture into their web-based journal management software, where documents are read from and saved to a database.</p>\n        <p>Texture is different from other web editors as it maintains a local state of the complete document in memory. This means the editor is always responsive and does not require a permanent internet connection while editing. This design allows for both offline editing and real time collaboration, where each collaborator maintains a local copy and only synchronizes changes with the other peers. If content is enhanced through online-services (e.g. DataCite, CrossRef) Texture stores a snapshot of the current data and a URI to the canonical resource so it can be automatically refreshed. Per the JATS standard, documents are fully self-contained. Complex XML stores and versioning are generally not in the scope of Texture, but users can provide their own backends. The editor can always be asked for a snapshot of the current JATS serialisation, or a listener can be registered to be called on each change, allowing for storing the complete editing history, on keystroke level if needed.</p>\n        <p>Unlike other HTML/XML editors, Texture keeps annotations separate from the text internally. A reference to the text element being annotated is stored along with the character offset (start, end) of the annotation (e.g. bold). Using this flat model, Texture can effectively handle overlapping of annotations, without ending up with very deep nesting or lots of fragments in the resulting XML.</p>\n        <p>Texture provides lossless conversion in that it recreates the schema of JATS in-memory, by utilising the XML schema. Most elements from the &lt;body&gt; and &lt;article-meta&gt; will then be editable out of the box. Some JATS elements, such as the &lt;contrib&gt; element, allow many different ways of tagging, which would require many different user interfaces for each tagging scenario. With Texture, we want to work towards flexible tagging conventions that can power the best possible user interfaces. Users of Texture (the consortium members) are defining those conventions collaboratively. According to agreed conventions Texture can then normalise certain elements providing extremely consistent tagging, which would be hard to achieve in a manual typesetting scenario.</p>\n      </sec>\n      <sec>\n        <title>Current and future use cases</title>\n        <p>At this initial stage, Texture is being developed to <bold>be used by a production team</bold> seeking to take the author&#x2019;s final version of a manuscript and produce production quality JATS for publishing purposes. In this case, a conversion tool is used to make an initial attempt at converting the peer-reviewed manuscript from Word or PDF (or another input format) to a(n imperfect) JATS article. This JATS would then be loaded into Texture, and, with the aid of visual cues from the Texture UI, a user would make iterative improvements to the underlying JATS. It is anticipated that Texture would be used to add additional detail (such as author affiliation information), correct conversion errors (such as misclassified information), or to provide additional granularity to existing tags (such as breaking up a &lt;mixed-reference&gt; into its constituent parts<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"bibd2e157\"/>). </p>\n        <p>In the future, however, Texture could be brought into the workflow at an earlier stage. Instead of providing Texture at the end of the editorial process, Texture could <bold>be used within the review or editing workflows</bold>. The automated conversion could be performed on the author&#x2019;s original manuscript, allowing the JATS XML, with Texture as a front-end, to be exclusively used for the review, copyediting, and proofs. While many journals and journal management platforms are designed around the uploading and downloading incrementally updated drafts of Microsoft Word manuscripts, there is an emerging trend toward document centric workflows (e.g., the Collaborative Knowledge Foundation platforms, eLife&#x2019;s Continuum, and PLOS&#x2019; Aperta) which use an HTML-rendered version of the manuscript for authors, reviewers, and journal staff to interact with. Texture could provide this HTML rendition (as a Web editor, it provides an HTML rendition of the underlying JATS XML). This approach works well with Texture's iterative improvement philosophy; at each stage in the workflow, authors and journal staff interact with the document and have the opportunity to improve the document towards its publication-ready final form. </p>\n        <p>Finally, yet another iteration of Texture could <bold>be used by authors </bold>even earlier in the process. In this case, instead of serving as an editor, Texture would be a from-scratch authoring tool, allowing authors to create production-ready XML documents from the beginning. The Substance library that Texture is built on already supports real-time collaborative authoring, and the easy-to-use WYSIWYG interface would make Texture an attractive alternative to Google Docs. Texture-authored documents could then be brought into the journal management system directly, skipping the conversion step, and move straight into a document-centric publishing workflow.</p>\n      </sec>\n    </sec>\n    <sec>\n      <title>Proof-of-concept implementation</title>\n      <p>Public Knowledge Project has continued to develop their <italic>Open Typesetting Stack</italic> (OTS) (<xref rid=\"R2\" ref-type=\"bibr\" id=\"ID2c41c887-e2fc-4c2a-91b6-e15b23fe1c0d\">Garnett, Willinsky, and Alperin, 2015</xref>) application for automatically transforming Word or PDF articles into JATS XML. We currently have an alpha plugin for integrating OTS into our Open Journal Systems publishing platform; this plugin includes Texture. Our solution, using the Open Typesetting Stack and Texture, aims to address the impracticalities of trying to \"reverse-engineer\" an author's work in Word while still supporting a polished, professional typesetting workflow.</p>\n      <p>The Open Typesetting Stack provides a toolchain for automatically converting Word or PDF documents to National Library of Medicine JATS XML. More than a dozen open source libraries are used to produce this result; parsing accuracy is better than any other known tool, at around 80% averaged across all document elements on a real-world corpus, but still generally not good enough for production-quality output by itself. Improving our automated parsing quality beyond 80% has, expectedly, slowed due to the many different ways to non-syntactically format a Word or PDF article, necessitating a supervised solution to finish the job. Unfortunately, because many publisher workflows are fairly idiosyncratic, it is not necessarily helpful to hand off this 80% accurate result to a typesetter on the assumption that they have specialized XML editing software to finish the job. Thus closing this 80% gap is still an issue.</p>\n      <fig id=\"fig2\">\n        <caption>\n          <title>Visual object processing in area AIP.</title>\n          <p>Example figure taken from <ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15278\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Schaffelhofer, Scherberger 2016</ext-link>.</p>\n        </caption>\n        <graphic mime-subtype=\"jpeg\" mimetype=\"image\" xlink:href=\"/static/texture/assets/fig2.jpg\"/>\n      </fig>\n      <p>When using the Open Typesetting Stack plugin in Open Journal Systems, authors and editors have the option to hand off any uploaded Word or PDF documents to OTS, whereupon they are replaced with OTS' JATS output for the remainder of the publishing workflow. As OTS' JATS output is generally not good enough to go directly to publication, users of OJS have the ability to continue editing directly in a Texture instance that is accessible from the OJS interface. The goal is to get authors and editors away from the original Word manuscript as early as possible in the publishing process, so that carrying forward changes to the eventual layout draft entails minimal duplicated effort. When articles are ready for publication, they can be resubmitted to OTS through another plugin hook, and it will return PDF and ePub transformations to OJS to be published alongside the XML.<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"bibd2e190\"/> More information, and a video demonstration, is available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://pkp.sfu.ca/open-typesetting-stack/\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:type=\"simple\">https://pkp.sfu.ca/open-typesetting-stack/</ext-link>.</p>\n\n      <table-wrap id=\"table1\">\n        <caption>\n          <title>Patient Care at End of Follow Up</title>\n          <p>Example table taken from <ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15886\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Pérez-Lara et. al., 2016</ext-link>.</p>\n        </caption>\n        <table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th valign=\"top\"><bold>Mutant</bold></th><th valign=\"top\"><bold>Lipid composition</bold></th><th valign=\"top\"><bold>Depth parameter (Φ)</bold></th><th valign=\"top\"><bold>Approx. distance to phosphate plane (Å)*</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\">M173R1</td><td valign=\"top\">20% PtdSer</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+1.20 ± 0.10</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+8.8</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"/><td valign=\"top\">5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></td><td valign=\"bottom\">−0.01 ± 0.20</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+5.5</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"/><td valign=\"top\">10% PtdSer + 2.5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></td><td valign=\"bottom\">+0.66 ± 0.10</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+7.4</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">F234R1</td><td valign=\"top\">20% PtdSer</td><td valign=\"bottom\">−0.10 ± 0.10</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+5.2</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"/><td valign=\"top\">5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></td><td valign=\"bottom\">−1.50 ± 0.03</td><td valign=\"bottom\">–0.6</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"/><td valign=\"top\">10% PtdSer + 2.5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></td><td valign=\"bottom\"> +0.00 ± 0.10</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+5.5</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">V304R1</td><td valign=\"top\">20% PtdSer</td><td valign=\"bottom\">−0.39 ± 0.20</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+4.3</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"/><td valign=\"top\">5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></td><td valign=\"bottom\">−1.30 ± 0.10</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+0.6</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"/><td valign=\"top\">10% PtdSer + 2.5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></td><td valign=\"bottom\">−0.23 ± 0.10</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+4.8</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">T329R1</td><td valign=\"top\">20% PtdSer</td><td valign=\"bottom\">−2.00 ± 0.14</td><td valign=\"bottom\">–5.4</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"/><td valign=\"top\">5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></td><td valign=\"bottom\">−0.80 ± 0.14</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+2.8</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"/><td valign=\"top\">10% PtdSer + 2.5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></td><td valign=\"bottom\">−2.10 ± 0.12</td><td valign=\"bottom\">–7.3</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">G368R1</td><td valign=\"top\">20% PtdSer</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+0.60 ± 0.10</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+7.2</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"/><td valign=\"top\">5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></td><td valign=\"bottom\">−0.64 ± 0.05</td><td valign=\"bottom\">+3.6</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"/><td valign=\"top\">10% PtdSer + 2.5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></td><td valign=\"top\">+0.18 ± 0.10</td><td valign=\"top\">+6.0</td></tr></tbody></table>\n      </table-wrap>\n    </sec>\n    <sec>\n      <title>Outlook</title>\n      <p>As far as \"getting away from Word\" is concerned, adoption of Texture by editors, reviewers, and late-stage collaborators should drive uptake, as will integration into journal publishing platforms such as Open Journal Systems.

How the brain computes these transformations is currently unclear. We investigated three key areas of the macaque cortical grasping circuit with microelectrode arrays and found cooperative but anatomically separated visual and motor processes. The parietal area AIP operated primarily in a visual mode. Its neuronal population revealed a specialization for shape processing, even for abstract geometries, and processed object features ultimately important for grasping. Premotor area F5 acted as a hub that shared the visual coding of AIP only temporarily and switched to highly dominant motor signals towards movement planning and execution. We visualize these non-discrete premotor signals that drive the primary motor cortex M1 to reflect the movement of the grasping hand.

Previous work suggests that in primates (including humans and monkeys), this transformation is coordinated in three key brain areas: the parietal cortex, the premotor cortex and the motor cortex. But exactly how these transformations are computed is still not clear.</p><p>Schaffelhofer and Scherberger attempted to find out how this transformation happens by recording the electrical activity from different brain areas as monkeys reached out to grasp different objects. The specific brain areas studied were the anterior intraparietal (AIP) area of the parietal cortex, a part of the premotor cortex known as F5, and the region of the motor cortex that controls hand movements. The exact movement made by the monkeys’ hands was also recorded.</p><p>Analysing the recorded brain activity revealed that the three brain regions worked together to transform information about an object into commands for the hand, although each region also had its own specific, separate role in this process. Neurons in the AIP area of the parietal cortex mostly dealt with visual information about the object. These neurons specialized in processing information about the shape of an object, including information that was ultimately important for grasping it. In contrast, the premotor area F5 represented visual information about the object only briefly, quickly switching to representing information about the upcoming movement as it was planned and carried out. Finally, the neurons in the primary motor cortex were only active during the actual hand movement, and their activity strongly reflected the action of hand as it grasped the object.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Schaffelhofer and Scherberger suggest that grasping movements are generated from visual information about the object via AIP and F5 neurons communicating with each other. The strong links between the premotor and motor cortex also suggest that a common network related to movement executes and refines the prepared plan of movement. Further investigations are now needed to reveal how such networks process the information they receive.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type=\"doi\" xlink:href=\"10.7554/eLife.15278.002\">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15278.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type=\"author-keywords\"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>parietal cortex</kwd><kwd>premotor cortex</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor transformation</kwd><kwd>parallel recording</kwd><kwd>hand grasping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type=\"research-organism\"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id=\"par-1\"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=\"FundRef\">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaffelhofer</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id=\"par-2\"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=\"FundRef\">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHE 1575/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherberger</surname><given-names>Hansjörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id=\"par-3\"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=\"FundRef\">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCCN-II, 01GQ1005C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherberger</surname><given-names>Hansjörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id=\"par-4\"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=\"FundRef\">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-611687 (NEBIAS)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherberger</surname><given-names>Hansjörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use=\"meta-only\"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cortical grasping circuit separates but shares visual and motor processes to transform object attributes into appropriate hand movements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id=\"s1\" sec-type=\"intro\"><title>Introduction</title><p>Grasping objects of different shapes and sizes appears trivial in daily life. We can distinguish between thousands of objects (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib3\">Biederman, 1987</xref>) and shape our hands according to their geometry in order to hold and manipulate them (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib27\">Napier, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib42\">Smeets and Brenner, 1999</xref>). Although such operations seem to be effortless, their underlying neuronal mechanisms are highly complex and require extensive computational resources (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib13\">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>). The cortical grasping network needs to translate high-dimensional visual information of an object into multidimensional motor signals that control the complex biomechanics of the hand.</p><p>In the primate brain, these processes are linked to the anterior intraparietal (AIP), the ventral premotor (F5), and the primary motor cortex (M1) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib6\">Brochier and Umilta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib7\">Castiello, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib9\">Davare et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib29\">Nelissen and Vanduffel, 2011</xref>). Within this network, AIP provides access to the dorsal visual stream that processes vision for action (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib8\">Culham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib18\">Goodale et al., 1994</xref>). In fact, neurons in AIP were shown to strongly respond to the presentation of graspable objects or 3D contours (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib25\">Murata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib44\">Taira et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib47\">Theys et al., 2012b</xref>), but could also encode specific grip types (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib1\">Baumann et al., 2009</xref>). This grasp-relevant information processed in AIP is exchanged with F5 via dense reciprocal connections (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">Borra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib23\">Luppino et al., 1999</xref>). Accordingly, deactivation of AIP or F5 causes severe deficits in pre-shaping the hand while approaching an object (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib15\">Fogassi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib16\">Gallese et al., 1994</xref>). In contrast to AIP, concurrent electrophysiological studies suggest that F5 is primarily encoding objects in motor terms and is storing context-specific grip type information (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib14\">Fluet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib32\">Raos et al., 2006</xref>). Connections of the dorsal subdivision of F5 (F5p) to the spinal cord and to M1 provide further evidence for the important role of F5 for grasp movement preparation (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib5\">Borra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib11\">Dum and Strick, 2005</xref>).</p><p>These electrophysiological and anatomical observations lead to our current understanding of the fronto-parietal network as the main circuitry for translating object attributes into motor commands (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib20\">Jeannerod et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</xref>). In detail, it has been suggested that visual features extracted in AIP activate motor prototypes in F5, which store hand configurations according to an object’s geometry (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</xref>). However, the detailed neural mechanisms of these processes remained unclear.</p><p>To create a deeper understanding of how visual information is transformed into motor commands, a precise identification and differentiation of visual and motor processes within the grasping network is required. Previous important grasping studies classified visual-dominant, visual-motor or motor-dominant neurons primarily on the phase of their activation [for AIP see <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib25\">Murata et al. (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib35\">Sakata et al. (1995)</xref>, for F5 see <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib32\">Raos et al. (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib46\">Theys et al. (2012a)</xref>], but they could not discriminate between neural coding of visual features of objects or motor features of the hand.</p><p>A differentiation between visual and motor coding is challenging for multiple reasons. First, the fronto-parietal network is multimodal and can reflect sensory and motor signals simultaneously. Second, visual and motor descriptions of objects and the hand are multidimensional due to the complexity of object geometry and hand physiology. Investigations at the neural level therefore necessitate multidimensional observations from many neurons. Third, the visual and motor spaces are highly linked to each other since the form of an object often defines the shape of the grasping hand. Disassociating both neuronal representations therefore requires highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses.</p><p>In this study, we took a multidimensional approach to identify and separate visual and motor processes in the grasping network of AIP, F5, and M1. We recorded large populations of neurons simultaneously from the entire network and compared their modulation patters to the visual attributes of highly diverse objects and the kinematic features recorded from the grasping hand. Our data revealed distinct roles of the grasping network in translating visual object attributes (AIP) into planning (F5) and execution signals (M1) and allowed visualizing the propagation of these features for grasping.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2\" sec-type=\"results\"><title>Results</title><p>Two macaque monkeys grasped a large set of 49 objects causing highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media1\">Video 1</xref>).

Of these units, 29.2% and 25.2% were recorded from AIP, 37.3% and 32.3% from F5, and 33.5% and 42.5% from M1 (monkey Z and M, respectively).</p><sec id=\"s2-1\"><title>Vision for hand action</title><p>Presenting 3D objects to the monkeys lead to vigorous discharge (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib1\">Baumann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib25\">Murata et al., 2000</xref>) of AIP-neurons (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2a–b</xref>). The modulated population was not only larger (sliding ANOVA, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>), but also significantly faster appearing after stimulus onset than in F5 (49.7 ms and 54.9 ms, monkey M and Z respectively). Impressively, individual AIP cells were capable of differentiating object shapes at high precision (e.g., <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2a</xref>). To quantify this attribute, we computed a modulation depth analysis that determined the relative difference in firing rate between all pairs of conditions (objects) during the cue epoch (see Materials and methods).

Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) performed on these distance measures confirmed the findings of the CDA and revealed a clear clustering according to object shape during visual presentation of the object (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2e</xref>) that widely persisted during movement execution, although with significantly shorter neural distances (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2f</xref>). 100% and 91% of the objects shared their cluster with other objects of the same shape during the cue and grasp epoch, respectively. Importantly, consistent results were observed in both monkeys when performing HCA across all recording sessions (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s2\">2</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p><p>The large number of objects presented in one recording session required separating the 48 objects on different turntables (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>), often objects of similar shape. This separation created small offsets already in the fixation epoch, but at very low modulations. An extreme case is shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2a</xref>. This might raise concerns on whether coding in AIP was really due to object shape, or rather to the object presentation order (different turntables presented sequentially). However, shape-wise clustering in AIP cannot be explained by the task design for the following reasons: (1) The offsets in the fixation epoch were very small in comparison to the visual modulations observed in AIP when the objects were presented (e.g., see <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media5\">Video 5</xref>). (2) The set of 'mixed' objects – presented and grasped in the same block – clustered with other objects of the same shape (e.g. ring in mixed block clusters with other ring objects). Together, this demonstrates clear shape processing in AIP.</p><p>The AIP population also encoded the size of objects, but differentiated this geometrical feature at clearly lower neural modulations compared to object shape. As shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2e–f</xref> and supplements, the majority of objects were located closest to objects of similar size, but with significantly shorter neural distances in comparison to shape features. The secondary role of size was surprising, since object size has significant influence on the aperture of the grasping hand (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib19\">Jakobson and Goodale, 1991</xref>).</p><p>To further test the specialisation for shape processing, we tested a mixed set of objects (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3a</xref>), causing highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses, against an abstract object set (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3d</xref>) that we have specifically designed to cause different visual stimuli but the same grip. In theory, a purely visual area should differentiate both sets of shapes, since they both provide different visual stimuli. In contrast, an exclusive motor area should not show modulations for the abstract objects because they require the same grip. Strikingly, the AIP population responded highly similar to the presentation (cue epoch) of mixed (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref>) and abstract (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3e</xref>) objects (t-test, p&gt;0.05; 35% vs. 35% and 20% vs. 17% comparing mixed and abstract objects in monkey Z and M, respectively). Thus, the equal responses to both object sets strongly supports the specialisation of AIP in processing object shapes.</p><p>Importantly, AIP remained the most tuned area when the monkeys planned and grasped the abstract objects, as shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3e</xref>. However, the number of significantly tuned cells decreased during these epochs in comparison to the responses evoked by the mixed objects (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref>). This reduced selectivity could indicate either motor or visual transformations that are both required for grasping: First, the abstract objects were grasped with the same hand configuration (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3d</xref>). Unmodulated activity could therefore reflect the same motor affordance across the six abstract objects (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</xref>). Second, the abstract objects have different shapes, but have the graspable handle in common that shares the same geometrical dimensions across all six objects (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3d</xref>). A uniform modulation could therefore also represent visual processes that reduce the objects to its parts relevant for grasping (i.e. the same geometries of the handle across the six abstract objects). Considering that the same AIP population separated the complete object set primarily on their geometrical features (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2e–f</xref>) would suggest visual rather than motor transformations explaining uniform modulations.</p><p>We found further indicators for this hypothesis when focusing on objects that caused, in contrast to the abstract objects, equal visual stimuli but different motor responses. To create such a scenario, monkeys were trained to perform power or precision grips on the same object, the handle (condition 00 and 01). Although both conditions were located most distantly in the kinematic or joint-angle (J-) space in both monkeys (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">5a</xref>), they were located closest to each other in the N-space of AIP (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2e–f</xref>), clearly implying a visual representation of the handle. Statistical analysis revealed, however, that both conditions (00, 01) slightly increased their neural distance (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2d</xref>) towards planning and movement execution, as expressed by an average of 21% and 16% of significantly tuned AIP neurons in monkey Z and M (ANOVA tested in grasp epoch, p&lt;0.01). These observations suggest a visual representation of the handle and a further differentiation of its parts that are relevant for grasping.<fig id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.7554/eLife.15278.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Motor planning and execution in F5.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Example neuron of F5, responding to all 50 task conditions (colour code as in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1b</xref>).

The F5 population was strongly activated in the motor epochs when the mixed objects were grasped differently (up to 47% and 45% tuned neurons in monkey Z and M resp., see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref>), and it was strikingly unmodulated when the abstract objects were grasped similar (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3e</xref>). Likewise, the M1 population responded uniformly for similar grips (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3e</xref>), but it was modulated very strongly when different hand configurations were applied (up to 67% and 61% in monkey Z an M resp, see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>During movement planning, M1 showed no or minimal preparation activity (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3a–c</xref>), whereas F5 revealed a multimodal role: in the cue epoch, the tuned F5 population substantially decreased from 28% to 18% in monkey Z, and from 13% to 4% in monkey M, when comparing abstract with mixed objects. This is in strong contrast to AIP, which demonstrated equal population responses for both type of object sets. The reduced F5 modulation suggests early motor processes starting shortly after object presentation. However, 18% and 4% (Monkey Z and M resp.) of all F5 neurons remained their modulation when the monkeys observed the abstract geometries. Thus, at least some F5 cells coded objects in purely visual terms.</p><p>It is notable, that we found significantly different contributions in motor preparation between the F5 recording sites. The visual (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3e–f</xref>) and visuomotor modulations (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b–c</xref>) prior to movement primarily originated from the ventral recording array, corresponding to the F5a subdivision (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib46\">Theys et al., 2012a</xref>). In fact, 76% of the visual (abstract objects) and 72% of visuomotor tuned neurons (mixed objects) recorded from F5 were detected on the ventral site (ANOVA p&lt;0.01, all sessions, tested in cue epoch), in line with previously reported enhanced decoding capabilities of planning signals from ventral F5 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib38\">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015a</xref>).

Neurons were modulated by hand grasping actions and typically showed the strongest MD during motor execution. The example neuron shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4a–b</xref> demonstrated a maximum MD of 39.8 Hz while grasping and allowed significantly separating 42% of all condition pairs in this epoch (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4b</xref>, right). Importantly, the neuron showed similar motor coding already during the preparation epoch (r = 0.76, between plan and grasp MD-maps, as shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4b</xref>). Using the planning activity of the example neuron alone, about 43% of the task conditions could be separated, thereby demonstrating the important role of F5 for hand movement planning.</p><p>To evaluate the relationship between neural population activity and motor actions, we recorded spiking activity (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4f–g</xref>) together with the kinematics of the primate hand (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4c–d</xref>). Dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, CDA) were performed to express the high dimensional kinematic (J-space) and neural space (N-space) in a low dimensional fashion.

In accordance with the low-dimensional representation, abstract forms, small objects, as well as the big rings and cylinders created individual clusters in the J-space and were located close to each other. As shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5b</xref>, these motor characteristics were rudimentarily marked in F5 already during motor preparation (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5b</xref>, coloured boxes). These clusters that emerged during motor planning persisted to a large extent during motor execution, but increased their relative distance to each other (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5c</xref>), in line with the higher MD of single F5 neurons during grasp execution (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4b</xref>). HCA performed on the averaged population response across all recording sessions (see Materials and methods) confirmed in both animals the motor characteristics of simultaneously recorded populations in single sessions (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s2\">2</xref>).</p><p>As discussed above, premotor preparation activity primarily originated from the ventral F5 array. Thus, the modulations observed prior to movement execution, such as observed in the CDA and hierarchical clustering, are mainly based on the ventral recording site. In contrast, both arrays significantly supported movement execution. The different modalities in both recording sites are in line with the architectonically (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib2\">Belmalih et al., 2009</xref>) and connectionally (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib5\">Borra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</xref>) distinct subdivisions F5a and F5p, which largely correspond to the ventral and dorsal recording array, respectively. Distinct connections of F5a with SII, AIP and other subdivision of F5 (but not to M1) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</xref>) suggest an integration of visual, motor and context specific information (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib48\">Theys et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, connections of F5p to the hand area of M1 and to the spinal cord (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib5\">Borra et al., 2010</xref>) suggest a rather direct contribution to hand movement control. Taken together, the multimodal preparation signals, including visual and motor contribution, and the distinct motor feature coding towards planning and execution, supports the key role of F5 for visuomotor transformation.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2-4\"><title>Feature coding in area M1</title><p>In agreement with the general population response (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref>), single neurons of M1 were almost exclusively modulated during movement execution and showed minimal modulations during preparatory epochs (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib49\">Umilta et al., 2007</xref>), as also indicated by the example neuron in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6a–b</xref>.

In accordance with the previous analysis, M1 demonstrated the highest similarity to the J-space (averaged value across 10 recording sessions for monkey M: 0.48, for monkey Z: 0.59), followed by F5 (monkey M: 0.61; monkey Z: 0.65) and AIP (monkey M: 0.75; monkey Z: 0.75).

The encoded motor features of F5 showed striking similarities with M1 thereby suggesting a strong collaboration of both areas during hand and movement control.</p><sec id=\"s3-1\"><title>Recording sites and relation to anatomical connections</title><p>We targeted the cortical grasping circuit with FMAs implanted under anatomical considerations. AIP, an end-stage area of the dorsal visual stream, receives input from parietal visual areas (e.g., LIP, CIP, and V6a) as well as from the inferior temporal cortex (e.g., areas TEa and TEm) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">Borra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib26\">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>). AIP further connects to pre-motor F5 via dense reciprocal projections (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">Borra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib23\">Luppino et al., 1999</xref>). In agreement with these known connections, we observed strong visuomotor responses in AIP and F5 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Another significant connection links F5 with the hand area of M1 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib11\">Dum and Strick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib21\">Kraskov et al., 2011</xref>). As described by <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib33\">Rathelot and Strick (2009)</xref>, neurons of M1, in particular in the bank of the central sulcus, form direct connections to <bold>α</bold>-motor neurons in the spinal cord that drive the distal hand muscles. In line with these observations, the majority of M1-neurons demonstrated significant modulations during hand movement control despite highly constant reaching components (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref>). Together, strong grasp modulations (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>) and their intercommunication (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref>) confirmed the correct positioning of the electrode arrays and the importance of all areas for visuomotor processing.</p></sec><sec id=\"s3-2\"><title>Visual processing for grasping</title><p>While it is known that area AIP and F5 strongly respond to the presentation of objects and to the variation of their dimensions (e.g. shape, orientation) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib1\">Baumann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib24\">Murata et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib25\">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib44\">Taira et al., 1990</xref>) it was unclear whether these modulations reflect visual or motor processes. For example, responses to object presentation can either reflect object attributes or instant motor representations as we have shown here (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>) and as suggested previously (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib24\">Murata et al., 1997</xref>). By design, our task created associations as well as dissociations between objects and their afforded hand configurations (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">5a</xref>) in order to disentangle these normally highly linked parameters.</p><p>The AIP population demonstrated a distinct visual separation of objects (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">3e</xref>), which was largely unrelated to the observed motor characteristics (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">5a</xref>), even when grasping in complete darkness (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig7\">Figure 7</xref>). The predominant criterion for object separation was object shape, even for abstract geometries that required the same grip (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3d–f</xref>). These findings are in agreement with anatomical connections of AIP to the inferior temporal cortex (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">Borra et al., 2008</xref>) that codes perceived shapes (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib22\">Logothetis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib45\">Tanaka, 1996</xref>). Object size was expressed in the population but played, surprisingly, only a secondary role in AIP (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2</xref>). These smaller neural distances with respect to size are remarkable, in particular since this feature is highly relevant for controlling hand aperture (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib19\">Jakobson and Goodale, 1991</xref>). A possible explanation for this effect could be the higher computational effort (more neurons) required for processing shape in comparison to size.</p><p>AIP also widely maintained its coding for visual object properties during movement execution in the dark (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2f</xref>), although with significantly smaller neural distances (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2e–f</xref>). We hypothesize that AIP serves as working memory and not only extracts, but also maintains visual object information required for motor planning and execution (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</xref>). We emphasize that visual coding at the population level does not preclude motor coding of some individual cells, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib24\">Murata et al., 1997</xref>). Rather, the evidence of bidirectional connections to F5 suggests that subpopulations exist in AIP that reflect feedback of motor signals.</p><p>Despite AIP’s primary visual coding, we observed a distinctive coding in the N-space when the same objects were grasped differently (e.g., handle and cylinders in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2c–d</xref>). These modulations could reflect either motor (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</xref>) or visual transformations required for grasping. In fact, when grasping an object, both processes are required: the visual selection of (focus on) object parts and the selection of a corresponding hand configuration. Several indicators in our data suggest visual rather than motor transformations in AIP: First, the population separated the entire set of objects in visual terms, but differentiated same objects when grasped differently. Second, the separation of the same object when grasped differently, originated from one object shape cluster. In line with these findings, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib1\">Baumann et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated that AIP planning activity depends on the previous visual knowledge of an object (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6</xref> in their paper). Presenting an object (the same handle as we used) caused a strong visual activation in the AIP population that got separated when a grip type (precision or power grip) was instructed subsequently. In contrast, instructing the grip type before object presentation did not lead to a substantial population response and caused significant modulations only after the object was presented. These differentiation schemes support our hypothesis of visual rather than motor transformations in AIP.</p></sec><sec id=\"s3-3\"><title>Motor planning and execution</title><p>Grasping requires the transformation of visual descriptions of an object into adequate motor commands.

Due to the large number of objects tested, we could demonstrate for the first time that the F5 population does not reflect stereotypical grip types (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</xref>), but represents a continuum of many hand configurations (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5</xref>), highly similar to M1 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media5\">Video 5</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, motor characteristics in the N-Space of F5 could be observed not only in motor execution epochs, but also during motor preparation (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4i</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">5b</xref>). In contrast to AIP, the F5 population showed already in the cue epoch a reduced tuning for abstract objects requiring the same grip (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3a–b</xref> vs. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 3d–e</xref>). This suggests a rapid appearance of grip features in F5 shortly after object presentation. However, F5 also contained a small subgroup of neurons that represented pure visual information during the cue epoch (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>). The vast majority of these cells have been recorded from the ventral array, i.e., they originate from the F5a subdivision. In line, electrophysiological investigations of area F5a demonstrated selectivity for 3D shape (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib46\">Theys et al., 2012a</xref>). We suggest that these neurons receive direct visual input from AIP and might be crucially involved in the activation of stored motor plans. Similar modulation patterns in AIP and F5 during object presentation suggest the communication of visual properties to premotor cortex (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media5\">Video 5</xref>). The presence of multimodal signals as well as the proximity of specialized sub areas for visual input and motor output suggest a central role of F5 for visuomotor transformation.</p><p>In contrast to F5, the hand area of primary motor cortex (M1) showed an almost exclusive role for motor execution (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib36\">Saleh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib49\">Umilta et al., 2007</xref>). We investigated, for the first time, the N-space of the hand area of M1 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib33\">Rathelot and Strick, 2009</xref>) for a large repertoire of grasping actions. As expected, the N-space of M1 was closely related to the J-space (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6</xref>) and showed the highest motor similarity across all three areas (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig7\">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Correlating these M1 modulation patterns with F5 revealed that both areas are not only strongly interconnected (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib11\">Dum and Strick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib21\">Kraskov et al., 2011</xref>), but they also heavily share motor features for grasping (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref>). The high similarity of the F5 and M1 population during movement execution (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4h</xref> vs. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6e</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref>, and <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media5\">Video 5</xref>) is in agreement with findings of similar coding schemes between both areas in spiking (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib49\">Umilta et al., 2007</xref>) and beta-band LFP activity (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib43\">Spinks et al., 2008</xref>). The earlier premotor (vs. motor) onset (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref>) suggests that the movement is facilitated by F5, whereas the closer motor similarity of M1 might reflect its advanced finger control capacity due to more direct motor connections (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib15\">Fogassi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib33\">Rathelot and Strick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib41\">Schieber and Poliakov, 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id=\"s3-4\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that the cortical grasping network transforms visual object attributes into motor plans and actions. We found highly different coding schemes between the frontoparietal circuits of AIP and F5, indicating widely separated processing of visual and motor features. These findings suggest that visuomotor transformation is achieved effectively by visual object descriptions that activate linked motor plans in the reciprocal network of AIP and F5. Strong feature communication between F5 and M1 further suggest a common motor network that executes and refines the prepared motor plan.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"s4\" sec-type=\"materials|methods\"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id=\"s4-1\"><title>Animal training and experimental setup </title><p>Two rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) participated in this study (animal Z: female, 7.0 kg body weight; animal M: male, 10.5 kg). Animal housing, care, and all experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with German and European laws governing animal welfare and were in agreement with the guidelines for the care and use of mammals in neuroscience and behavioural research (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib28\">National Research Council, 2003</xref>; see also Ethics statement). </p><p>We developed an experimental setup that allowed us to present a large number of graspable objects to the monkeys while monitoring their behaviour, neural activity and hand kinematics. During each recording session, monkeys grasped a total of 42–48 objects of equal weight that were placed on 8 interchangeable turntables (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1a–b</xref>). Objects were of different shapes and sizes including <italic>rings</italic> (diameter of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm), <italic>cubes</italic> (length of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm), <italic>spheres</italic> (diameter of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 mm), <italic>horizontal cylinders</italic> (diameter of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mm, equal length), <italic>vertical cylinders</italic> (diameter: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mm, equal height), and <italic>bars</italic> (depth of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm, equal height and width). Furthermore, a <italic>mixed</italic> turntable held objects of different shapes of average size. Important for this study, a special turntable was holding objects of <italic>abstract forms</italic>, which differed largely visually but required identical hand configurations for grasping (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1b</xref>). Both monkeys were also trained to grasp a single object, a handle, either with a precision grip or a power grip. This extended our task by two more conditions (to a total of 50) that evoked similar visual, but different motor responses. In 20 recording sessions (10 per animal), each condition was repeated at least 10 times.</p><p>Precision and power grips applied on the handle as well as grasping and lifting the 3D-objects were detected with photoelectric barriers (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib38\">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015a</xref>). The turntable position was controlled with a step motor. Furthermore, the monkey’s eye position was monitored with an optical eye tracking system (model AA-EL-200; ISCAN Inc.). All behavioural and task-relevant parameters were controlled using a custom-written control software implemented in LabVIEW Realtime (National Instruments, Austin, TX).</p></sec><sec id=\"s4-2\"><title>Task paradigm</title><p>Monkeys were trained to grasp 49 objects (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1b</xref>) in a delayed grasp-and-hold task (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1d</xref>). While sitting in the dark the monkeys could initiate a trial (self-paced) by placing their grasping hand (left hand in monkey Z, right hand in monkey M) onto a rest sensor that enabled a fixation LED close to the object. Looking at (fixating) this spot for a variable time (fixation epoch, duration: 500–800 ms) activated a spot light that illuminated the graspable object (cue epoch: 700 ms). After the light was turned off the monkeys had to withhold movement execution (planning epoch: 600–1000 ms) until the fixation LED blinked for 100 ms. After this, the monkeys released the rest sensor, reached for and grasped the object (movement epoch), and briefly lifted it up (hold epoch: 500 ms). The monkeys had to fixate the LED throughout the task (max. deviation: ~5 deg of visual angle). In trials where the handle was grasped, one of two additional LEDs was presented during the cue epoch, which indicated to perform either a precision grip (yellow LED) or a power grip (green LED). All correctly executed trials were rewarded with a liquid reward (juice) and monkeys could initiate the next trial after a short delay. Error trials were immediately aborted without reward and excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id=\"s4-3\"><title>Kinematics recording</title><p>Finger, hand, and arm kinematics of the acting hand were tracked with an instrumented glove for small primates (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1a,c</xref>). Seven magnetic sensor coils (model WAVE, Northern Digital) were placed onto the fingernails, the hand’s dorsum as well as the wrist to compute the centres of 18 individual joints in 3D space, including thumb, digits, wrist, elbow and shoulder. The method and its underlying computational model have been described previously (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib37\">Schaffelhofer and Scherberger, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recorded joint trajectories were then used to drive a 3D-musculoskeletal model (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib39\">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015b</xref>), which was adjusted to the specific anatomy of each monkey. The model was implemented in OpenSim (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib10\">Delp et al., 2007</xref>) and allowed extracting a total of 27 DOF [see <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib39\">Schaffelhofer et al. (2015b)</xref> for detailed list of DOF]. All extracted joint angles from the model were low-pass filtered (Kaiser window, finite impulse response filter, passband cutoff: 5–20 Hz), downsampled to 50 Hz and used to describe the hand configuration in a 27-dimensional joint space (J-space).</p></sec><sec id=\"s4-4\"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Single and multiunit activity was recorded simultaneously using floating microelectrode arrays (FMA, Microprobe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA). In each monkey we recorded from in total 192 channels of 6 individual arrays implanted into the cortical areas AIP, F5, and M1 (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1e–g</xref>). In each array, the lengths of the electrodes increased towards the sulcus and ranged from 1.5 (1<sup>st</sup> row) to 7.1 mm (4<sup>th</sup> row). In area F5, one array was placed in the posterior bank of the inferior arcuate sulcus approximately targeting F5a (longer electrodes) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib46\">Theys et al., 2012a</xref>) and approaching the F5 convexity (F5c; shorter electrodes). The second and more dorsally located array was positioned to target F5p. In AIP, the arrays were implanted into the end of the posterior intraparietal sulcus at the level of area PF and more dorsally at the level of area PFG. In M1, both arrays were placed into the hand area of M1 into the anterior bank of the central sulcus at the level of the spur of the arcuate sulcus (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib33\">Rathelot and Strick, 2009</xref>). See <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib38\">Schaffelhofer et al. (2015a)</xref> for details on surgical procedures. Neural activity was recorded at full bandwidth with a sampling frequency of 24 kHz and a resolution of 16 bits (model: RZ2 Biosignal Processor; Tucker Davis Technologies, FL, USA). Neural data was synchronously stored to disk together with the behavioural and kinematic data. Raw recordings were filtered offline (bandpass cutoff: 0.3––7 kHz) before spikes were detected (threshold: 3.5x std) and extracted. Spike sorting was processed in two steps: First, we applied super-paramagnetic clustering (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib31\">Quiroga et al., 2004</xref>) and then revised the results by visual inspection using Offline sorter (Plexon, TX, USA) to detect and remove neuronal drift and artefacts. No other pre-selection was applied and single and multiunit activity have been analysed together.</p></sec><sec id=\"s4-5\"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id=\"s4-5-1\"><title>Firing rate and modulation depth</title><p>Firing rate plots were created in order to visualize the activity of example neurons across time. For this, spike rates were smoothed with a Gaussian Kernel (σ = 50 ms) over time and then averaged across trials of the same condition (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib1\">Baumann et al., 2009</xref>). To illustrate the response of a specific condition we used the colour code as introduced in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1b</xref>. Furthermore, we visualized the modulation depth (MD) of example neurons in specific epochs of interest. The MD between two conditions was defined as their absolute difference in average firing rate. This measure was computed for all possible pairs of conditions and visualized as a colour-map. In addition, we performed multi-comparison tests to check whether the differences in firing rate between conditions were significant (ANOVA, Tukey-Kramer criterion, p&lt;0.01; ≥10 trials/condition, ≥500 trials/session, Matlab functions: anova1, multcompare).</p></sec><sec id=\"s4-5-2\"><title>Sliding ANOVA population analysis</title><p>To investigate the population activity during the course of the trial, we tested for significant tuning at multiple time points t using a 1-way ANOVA. Similar to the visualization of firing rates, we first smoothed all spike trains with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 50 ms) and then performed a sliding ANOVA in time steps of 1 ms (p&lt;0.01; no multi-comparison correction, ≥10 trials/condition). Sliding ANOVA results were then averaged across all recording sessions to visualize results (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>). Due to the variable length of the planning epoch, trials were first aligned to the cue-onset and then to the grasp-onset event. Abstract shapes were introduced at a later stage of the project (included in 12 recording sessions, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3e</xref>), whereas all other conditions were tested in all 20 recording sessions (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref>). Please note: Irregular grips were detected in the J-space and excluded for the sliding ANOVA analysis of the abstract shapes (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref>). Only 17 trials in 12 recording sessions were excluded to guarantee equal hand configurations for statistical analysis.</p><p>To calculate the visual response times of an area of interest (i.e. AIP and F5) we measured the time between cue onset and 75% of the population’s peak activity. Response times were averaged across recording sessions for each animal and tested for significant differences.</p></sec><sec id=\"s4-5-3\"><title>Dimensionality reduction</title><p>To compare and visualize the simultaneously recorded high-dimensional data (J- and N-space), we applied dimensionality reduction methods. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to express the data variability of the J-space in a compact, lower-dimensional fashion. This approach was demonstrated to be optimal for describing hand shapes (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib30\">Pesyna et al., 2011</xref>). As an input for PCA, we computed for each trial and DOF the mean joint angle during the hold epoch (in degrees). This let for each trial to a 27-dimensional joint position vector in J-space that robustly described the monkey’s average hand configuration during the hold epoch, and across all trials to an input matrix of dimension: trials x DOF.</p><p>For exploring the N-space (neuronal population space), we applied canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). Similar to PCA, CDA creates a new transform of the original dataset spanned by linear combinations of the original variables. Whereas PCA creates the new coordinate system in a way that maximizes the total variance, CDA transforms the data in order to maximize the separation of groups (here: task conditions). The first axis in the new transform (first canonical variable) therefore reflects the linear combination of original variables that show the most significant F-statistic in a one-way analysis of variance. The second canonical variable is orthogonal to the first one and has maximum separation within the remaining dimensions.</p><p>We performed CDA based on the population's mean firing rates of a specific task epoch of interest (e.g., grasp epoch) relative to baseline activity. This means, a population matrix consists of entries that correspond to the mean firing rate of individual neurons for all trials in a certain time interval (dimensions: trials x number of neurons). In contrast to other dimensionality reduction methods, CDA considers only variances of the signal related to conditional differences. Due to this advantage, noise or condition-irrelevant modulations get suppressed.</p><p>For a fair comparison, all dimensionality reduction results presented for the individual areas originated from the same recording session per monkey (e.g. AIP, F5 and M1 populations shown from monkey Z or M) and were therefore recorded simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id=\"s4-5-4\"><title>Procrustes analysis</title><p>Procrustes analysis (PCRA) can be used to test similarities or differences between multidimensional datasets of different measures and scales. In the context of this study, PCRA was used to evaluate the resemblance between the J- and the N-space (firing rates). For this, we reduced both representations to their highest common dimension (i.e., 27 DOF of hand and arm) using the dimensionality reduction methods explained above (i.e., CDA for N-space). This produced datasets of identical number of trials (e.g., 600) and dimensions (e.g., 27). Then PCRA was used to translate and rotate the space of interest (e.g., N-space of M1, F5, or AIP) in a way that minimized the sum of squared distances (SSD) to the corresponding points in the reference space (e.g., J-space) (Matlab function: procrustes). The resulting transform was used to visualize and quantify the amount of similarity to the reference space (J-space). As a numerical measure of similarity, the sum of squared distances between the new transform and the reference frame was computed and normalized by the sum of squared distances between points of the reference space to their dimensional means (Matlab function: procrustes). This similarity measure is a non-negative number with values near 0 implying a high similarity between the multidimensional spaces and values approaching (or exceeding) 1 implying strong dissimilarity.</p></sec><sec id=\"s4-5-5\"><title>Hierarchical cluster analysis</title><p>To illustrate and compare the many conditions of our task in an untransformed, full-dimensional way, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). We first computed the Mahalanobis distances between the population activities (N-space) of all possible pairs of task conditions in an epoch of interest (Matlab function: manova1). This resulting distance matrix (e.g., for 50 x 50 conditions) was used to create an agglomerative hierarchical cluster tree based on the average linkage criterion (Matlab function: manovacluster), presenting the cluster solutions of an individual recording session as dendrograms (e.g. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2e–f</xref> for AIP of animal Z). Additionally, we averaged the Mahalanobis distance matrices of all individual session to build dendrograms expressing the N-space of an animal across all recording sessions (e.g. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for AIP of animal Z).</p></sec><sec id=\"s4-5-6\"><title>Feature code correlation</title><p>For correlating the dynamic feature communicated within the grasping network we (1) binned the spiking activity of each individual neuron (bin width = 10 ms), (2) smoothed the firing rates with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 300 ms) and (3) aligned the firing vectors to both cue and grasp onset. Within each of the resulting bins we then (4) computed the Euclidean distance between all possible pairs of trials in the N-space. This leads, separately for each area AIP, F5 and M1, to a distance matrix of the size <italic>m<sup>2</sup></italic>, where m is the number of trials that represents the neural population difference across different trials and trial conditions. Pairs of such matrices from AIP, F5, and M1 were then (5) correlated for every time bin (Spearman’s correlation coefficient), which led to a correlation function across time for each pair of areas (AIP-F5, AIP-M1, and F5-M1). This correlation function represents for every time in the task the similarity of the encoded features between both areas. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media5\">Video 5</xref> visualizes these distance matrices and the resulting correlation function over the time.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id=\"ack\"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank M Sartori, M Dörge, K Menz, R Ahlert, N Nazarenus, and L Burchardt for assistance and MM Fabiszak, M Hepp-Reymond, and W Freiwald for helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Simultaneous recordings in these areas from arrays of electrodes were performed. The animals were trained on an excellent grasping task that used a variety of 3D objects and dissociated the different parts of a grasping task into its component parts (e.g. visual, motor planning, motor action). In addition to the use of sophisticated behavioral and recording protocols, the authors also used a glove to quantitatively measure kinematic aspects of grasping movements. The complex data from multiple areas and recording channels as well as movement parameters were analyzed in sophisticated ways to permit novel insight into the transformation of visual signals in areas AIP and F5 to motor planning and action in F5 and M1. I'll leave the detailed critique to the expert reviewer. In focusing on a larger picture in this particular area, I found this paper outstanding in all respects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) The main limit of this beautiful work is the assumption that area F5 is anatomo-functionally unitary. Recent literature not considered in this work shows that F5 is neither architectonically (Belmalih et al. 2009) nor connectionally (Gerbella et al. 2011) homogeneous: the ventral and anterior part of F5 (called F5a, where the most lateral arrays in the present study have been implanted), hosts 3D-shape-selective and &quot;visual-dominant&quot; neurons (Theys et al. 2012), commonly found also in AIP (Theys et al. 2013) but not in the dorsal part of F5 (i.e. F5p, see Bonini et al. 2014). Furthermore, while in the introduction the authors generally talk about &quot;connections of F5 to the spinal cord and M1&quot;, this is true virtually only for F5p (Borra et al. 2010). Considering altogether data recorded from different F5 subdivisions was acceptable in the authors' previous paper (Schaffelhofer et al. 2015, J Neurosci), as its goal was to decode hand configurations, but not here, where the authors want to elucidate the functioning of the cortical grasping network.</p><p>2) Strictly related to this issue, the electrodes length is unknown. From the authors' previous works (Schaffelhoefer et al. 2015a and Townsend et al. 2011) I infer that &quot;electrode length ranged from 1.5 to 7.1 mm&quot;, with the longest electrodes toward the sulcus. Thus, the more superficial electrodes of the lateral arrays certainly sampled F5c motor activity, likely related to mouth and hand movements, (see Graziano et al. 1997 and Maranesi et al. 2012), while the deepest electrodes most likely sampled F5p/a visuomotor activity. Please clarify.</p><p>3) &quot;Data have been analysed from 20 recording sessions (10 per animal)…&quot;. I don't understand how many (single and multi) units have been used for the analyses. It seems that a total of about 202 (units)*10 (sessions)=2020 and 355*10=3550 &quot;units&quot; have been considered in the two animals, respectively: with chronic recording this approach would certainly imply some resampling of the same &quot;units&quot; across sessions, increasing their number but reducing the variability of their discharge. At the same time, the authors stated in the Materials and methods section that &quot;all dimensionality reduction results presented for the individual areas originated from the same recording session per monkey&quot;, which actually sounds fair, but in contrast with the previous consideration. Please clarify.</p><p>4) I recommend using the same y-axis scales for plots in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3 (b and d</xref>). Nevertheless, it is clear that the tuning profile of AIP does not change when abstract or mixed sets of objects are used (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b and d</xref>): I totally understand the authors' reasoning, but they will acknowledge that all the abstract objects share an elongated shape, while those of the mixed set are much more variable. Thus, the lack of difference in the AIP tuning profile between the two sets is strange and should be better explained/discussed. For example, could it be due to receptive fields properties of AIP neurons (see Romero et al. 2014; Romero and Janssen 2016)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Altogether, I consider the work exceptional. The data make new and important contributions to understanding the cortical mechanisms underlying grasp control. By concurrently recording and characterising the relationships between limb kinematics and neural activity from AIP, F5, and M1 while monkeys viewed and grasped a wide range of objects, the scope of the current investigation is unparalleled in the current primate neurophysiological literature. Also outstanding are the beautiful data visualisation methods that the authors advance here.</p><p>I have a few suggestions, however, detailed below. My hope is that the authors will find these comments constructive.</p><p><italic>A) Main concerns:</italic></p><p>(A-1) The role of AIP</p><p>I'm having some difficulty understanding the authors’ stance on the role of AIP. I believe they are arguing that their data suggest that AIP is encoding object properties in visual terms, and not in motoric terms. They suggest that the results of their CDA show that AIP encodes objects according to shape in visual space, independent of the way they are grasped.</p><p>My interpretation of their stance is that AIP activity does not reflect action possibilities in sensorimotor terms – but rather reflects the 'flagging' of visual features relevant for actions, but NOT (yet) represented as spatiomotor plans.</p><p>If this is indeed their stance, I see this as a significant departure from prior conceptualizations (Jeannerod et al., 1995).</p><p>However, I remain confused about this argument, both (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib1\">1</xref>) conceptually, and (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib2\">2</xref>) with respect to how some aspects of their data can be viewed as consistent these claims.</p><p>1) Conceptually. The authors talk about &quot;object affordances&quot; as different from &quot;motor affordances&quot;.</p><p>To me, affordances = action possibilities; they are sensory representations of the external environment that are inseparably linked to the motor apparatus and capabilities of the perceiving animal. In other words, affordances are, according to my understanding, inextricably motor.</p><p>What does it mean to &quot;extract object affordances relevant for grasping&quot;, but to not at the same time encode those same objects according to the spatiomotor properties required for their manual interaction?</p><p>They state: &quot;…suggest encoding of object affordances rather than motor affordances&quot;.</p><p>I urge the authors to better clarify what is meant by object vs. motor affordances.</p><p>2) Data. Some aspects of AIP data suggest encoding related to motoric features.</p><p>a) Shift for same object – big horizontal cylinders – when grasped from below vs. above.</p><p>b) Significant differentiation of conditions 00 vs. 01.</p><p>c) Motor similarity measures – <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig7\">Figure 7</xref> – presumably a measure of.75 for AIP is different than a measure of &quot;1&quot; – and thus, does suggest some correspondence between N- and J-space encoding in AIP</p><p>d) Also, there interpretation of <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref> vs. d – &quot;…observed encoding of abstract objects in AIP can be explained exclusively by object shape.&quot;</p><p>Is it not possible that these data may reflect the fact that abstract versus mixed object set have more graspable parts – a greater number of possible actions –, and AIP encoding is sensitive to these differences?</p><p>This account could be considered consistent with the authors’ interpretations regarding the evidence for reduced tuning in AIP over time for abstract shapes: &quot;…reduction of 3D shapes to the relevant parts for grasping…&quot;.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>While the authors seem to argue for a strict separation in roles between AIP and F5 – visual vs. motor, respectively – I see the data as more likely evidence for a continuum – a graded difference – visual prevalence in AIP, with motor encoding vs. motoric prevalence in F5, with visual encoding.</p><p>I suggest that the authors clarify their stance, and/or temper their arguments.</p><p><italic>B) Intermediate concerns</italic></p><p>B-1) in the Introduction, the authors state that prior work did not dissociate between visual and motor features. At first, I thought this was inconsistent with the work of Sakata and colleagues – describing visual dominant, visuomotor, and motor dominant cell types. I think some discussion of this work upfront, including how the current approach critically differs, would be helpful.</p><p>B-2) Introduction – last paragraph – it isn't clear to me what the authors mean to say here, without first reading the rest of the paper. I think this section could be made clearer.</p><p>B-3) I'm not sure I understand their explanation of the shape-specificity prior to fixation. Please try to make this clearer.</p><p>B-4) At first I thought I missed something – it seemed as though AIP was not looked at in terms of J- and N-space encoding in the same way that F5 and M1 were. However, later it is clear that they did analyse AIP in the same way. Why not also show these data, as they do for F5 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">5</xref>) and M1 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6</xref>)?</p><p>B-5) <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4</xref> – it is unclear to me why they plot J-space for the hold epoch and N-space for the grasp epoch; why not show results from the same epochs?</p><p>B-6) <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref> – and the authors' discussion of the driving influence of F5 on M1 activity – how do these findings relate to (Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008)? I think these studies should be explicitly discussed.</p><p>Also, is it not surprising to find so little evidence for correspondence between AIP and F5 during planning?</p><p>How does the relationship between AIP and F5 that the authors suggest according to their new results compare with prior accounts – e.g. Jeannerod et al., 1995; Fagg and Arbib, 1998?</p><p>How do the authors interpret the increased AIP-M1 correspondence during grasp and hold?</p><p>B-7) What do the authors mean by the statement regarding M1 on p.26 &quot;…its neuronal population has never been studied explicitly&quot;? What about, for e.g., the work of Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008?</p><p>References:</p><p>Fagg AH, Arbib MA (1998) Modeling parietal-premotor interactions in primate control of grasping.

Recent literature not considered in this work shows that F5 is neither architectonically (Belmalih et al. 2009) nor connectionally (Gerbella et al. 2011) homogeneous: the ventral and anterior part of F5 (called F5a, where the most lateral arrays in the present study have been implanted), hosts 3D-shape-selective and &quot;visual-dominant&quot; neurons (Theys et al. 2012), commonly found also in AIP (Theys et al. 2013) but not in the dorsal part of F5 (i.e. F5p, see Bonini et al. 2014).

However, the technique has the disadvantage of static electrode positions (non-moveable). In other words, a large number of channels are required for acquiring a sufficient sample size of modulated neurons. Primarily for this reason, we have merged the recording sites within area F5 (F5p and F5a). However, we agree of course that F5 consists of specialized sub regions that we have now analyzed and visualized separately (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3 c,f</xref>). Specifically, we mapped all identified visual and visuomotor neurons in each of the six electrode arrays. As expected, we found significant differences between the F5 subdivisions consistent with the current literature and your comments. In contrast to F5a, F5p did not (monkey M) or only minimally (monkey Z) contribute to movement planning, but instead was modulated during movement execution.</p><p>Beside the new <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3c,f</xref>, we changed the following parts of the manuscript:</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph:</p><p>“Connections of the dorsal subdivision of F5 (F5p) to the spinal cord and to M1 provide further evidence of the area’s important role in grasp movement preparation (Borra et al., 2010; Dum and Strick, 2005).“</p><p>Motor planning and execution, last paragraph:</p><p>“It is notable, that we found significantly different contributions in motor preparation between the F5 recording sites. The visual (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3e-f</xref>) and visuomotor modulations (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b-c</xref>) prior to movement primarily originated from the ventral recording array, corresponding to the F5a subdivision (Gerbella et al., 2011; Theys et al., 2012a). In fact, 76% of the visual (abstract objects) and 72% of visuomotor tuned neurons (mixed objects) recorded from F5 were detected on the ventral site (ANOVA p&lt;0.01, all sessions, tested in cue epoch), in line with previously reported enhanced decoding capabilities of planning signals from ventral F5 (Schaffelhofer et al., 2015a). In contrast, the dorsal F5 array, corresponding to F5p, mainly contributed during movement execution by a four-fold increase of its tuned population with respect to the cue epoch.”</p><p>Feature coding in area F5, last paragraph:</p><p>“As discussed above, premotor preparation activity primarily originated from the ventral F5 array. Thus, the modulations observed prior to movement execution, such as observed in the CDA and hierarchical clustering, mainly based on the ventral recording site. In contrast, both arrays significantly supported movement execution. The different modalities in both recording sites are in line with the architectonical (Belmalih et al., 2009) and connectionally (Borra et al., 2010; Gerbella et al., 2011) distinct subdivisions F5a and F5p, which largely correspond to the ventral and dorsal recording array, respectively. Distinct connections of F5a with SII, AIP and other subdivision of F5 (but not to M1) (Gerbella et al., 2011) suggest an integration of visual, motor and context specific information (Theys et al., 2013). On the other hand, connections of F5p to the hand area of M1 and to the spinal cord (Borra et al., 2010) suggest a rather direct contribution to hand movement control. Taken together, the multimodal preparation signals with visual and motor contribution and the distinct motor feature coding towards planning and execution supports the important role of F5 in visuomotor transformation.”</p><p><italic>2) Strictly related to this issue, the electrodes length is unknown. From the authors' previous works (Schaffelhoefer et al. 2015a and Townsend et al. 2011) I infer that &quot;electrode length ranged from 1.5 to 7.1 mm&quot;, with the longest electrodes toward the sulcus. Thus, the more superficial electrodes of the lateral arrays certainly sampled F5c motor activity, likely related to mouth and hand movements, (see Graziano et al. 1997 and Maranesi et al. 2012), while the deepest electrodes most likely sampled F5p/a visuomotor activity. Please clarify.</italic></p><p>Thank you for reading the manuscript so carefully. We have now added the electrode length in the following sections:</p><p>Legend of <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>: “…(f) Electrode placement in monkey Z (right hemisphere). Each array consisted of 2 ground and 2 reference electrodes (black), as well as 32 recording channels (white) aligned in a 4x9 matrix. Electrode length for each row increased towards the sulcus from 1.5 – 7.1 mm. (g) Same for monkey M (left hemisphere)…”.</p><p>[Please note that <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1f-g</xref> has been adapted accordingly to illustrate individual channels]</p><p>Chapter “Electrophysiological recordings”:</p><p>“In each array, the lengths of the electrodes increased towards the sulcus and ranged from 1.5 (1<sup>st</sup> row) to 7.1mm (4<sup>th</sup> row). In area F5, one array was placed in the posterior bank of the inferior arcuate sulcus approximately targeting F5a (longer electrodes)(Theys et al., 2012) and approaching the F5 convexity (F5c; shorter electrodes). The second and more dorsally located array was positioned to target F5p. In AIP, the arrays were implanted into the end of the posterior intraparietal sulcus at the level of area PF and more dorsally at the level of area PFG. In M1, both arrays were placed into the hand area of M1 into the anterior bank of the central sulcus at the level of the spur of the arcuate sulcus (Rathelot and Strick, 2009)”.</p><p>We believe that the updated <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">2</xref> and the corresponding updates in the text now provide full details of the location of the implanted electrodes.</p><p> <italic>3) &quot;Data have been analysed from 20 recording sessions (10 per animal)…&quot;. I don't understand how many (single and multi) units have been used for the analyses. It seems that a total of about 202 (units)*10 (sessions)=2020 and 355*10=3550 &quot;units&quot; have been considered in the two animals, respectively: with chronic recording this approach would certainly imply some resampling of the same &quot;units&quot; across sessions, increasing their number but reducing the variability of their discharge. At the same time, the authors stated in the Materials and methods section that &quot;all dimensionality reduction results presented for the individual areas originated from the same recording session per monkey&quot;, which actually sounds fair, but in contrast with the previous consideration. Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>Yes, we recorded in average 202 and 355 neurons from monkey Z and M, respectively (10 sessions per animal, see Results, paragraph 3). The reason we have not stated the summed number of neurons across sessions is exactly because of the resampling of neurons (due to the day-to-day stability of electrodes with respect to their position). The high unit counts you mentioned are correct (591 AIP + 677 M1 + 753 F5 cells = 2021 cells in animal Z, and 892 AIP, 1507 M1 and 1146 F5 cells = 3545 in animal M) but could potentially give the reader the incorrect impression about the sum of <italic>unique</italic>neurons and we therefore avoided them. Thus, to provide the fairest unit counts, we stated the average cell count per session and averaged analysis results accordingly (see Figure. 3, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig7\">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>For results that reflect individual sessions, we have added the number of included cells to each individual Figure (please see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">5</xref>, and 6 and their corresponding supplements). For the single session analysis, we have explicitly mentioned “all dimensionality reduction results are from the same recording session” to make clear that we did not select the “best” representations we could find within 10 sessions for each of the individual areas (AIP, F5 and M1), but instead presented populations from the same recording session. This step should increase the comparability of results between individual areas.</p><p>Moreover, we have made clear that single and multi-units have been analyzed together. See chapter “Electrophysiological recordings”, last sentence: “No other pre-selection was applied and single and multiunit activity have been analysed together.”</p><p>The manuscript now provides detailed information for each analysis with respect to unit count.</p><p>Somewhat related to your comment, we also solved a question that has been important to us. We added a variation of the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) in order to express the coding of task conditions across recording sessions (in addition to individual sessions). For this, we measured the Mahalanobis distance between each pair of group means (e.g., between condition 00 and 11) resulting in a 50 x 50 distance matrix. These matrices, observed from each individual session, were averaged across all recording sessions and then used as a basis for an across-session HCA. The resulting dendrograms are now shown as supplemental figures in addition to the results of individual example sessions (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s2\">2</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s1\">Figure 5 —figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6s1\">Figure 6 —figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6s2\">2</xref>). The following sections of the manuscript were altered:</p><p>Chapter “Hierarchical Cluster Analysis”, end of chapter:</p><p>“Additionally, we averaged the Mahalanobis distance matrices of all individual session to build dendrograms expressing the N-space of an animal across all recording sessions (e.g. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</xref> for AIP of animal Z).”</p><p>Chapter “Vision for hand action”, end of paragraph 3:</p><p>“Importantly, consistent results were observed in both monkeys when performing HCA across all recording sessions (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s2\">2</xref>, see Materials and methods).”</p><p>Chapter “Feature coding in area F5”, end of paragraph 7:</p><p>“HCA performed on the averaged population response across all recording sessions (see Materials and methods) confirmed in both animals the motor characteristics of simultaneously recorded populations in single sessions (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s1\">Figure 5 —figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s2\">2</xref>).</p><p>Chapter “Feature coding in area M1”, last paragraph:</p><p>“The similarity of J- and N-space of M1 was not only visible in the first two components, but was also quantified across all dimensions in the hierarchical cluster trees of the simultaneously recorded M1 population (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6 d,f</xref>) and when averaging the population response across all recording sessions (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6s1\">Figure 6 —figure supplement 1</xref>-2 for monkey M and Z, resp.).”</p><p> <italic>4) I recommend using the same y-axis scales for plots in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">figure 3 (b and d</xref>). Nevertheless, it is clear that the tuning profile of AIP does not change when abstract or mixed sets of objects are used (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b and d</xref>): I totally understand the authors' reasoning, but they will acknowledge that all the abstract objects share an elongated shape, while those of the mixed set are much more variable. Thus, the lack of difference in the AIP tuning profile between the two sets is strange and should be better explained/discussed. For example, could it be due to receptive fields properties of AIP neurons (see Romero et al. 2014; Romero and Janssen 2016)?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We updated the y-axis scales according to your suggestion.</p><p>The similar quantitative responses (in terms of percentage of significantly tuned neurons) for the abstract and mixed shapes, in our opinion, are not strange but strikingly extend our findings from the complete object set. We understand that a higher variation in object shape could have affected the number of tuned cells, in stark contrast to the observed minor differences presented in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>. However, monkeys viewed the objects from the side, which substantially reduced the apparent visual uniformity of the abstract object set (less elongated profiles). Furthermore, we report in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref> the percentage of significantly tuned neurons, and not, for example, the average tuning strength (e.g., the difference between the strongest and weakest response in each object set), which might have been a more sensitive measure for detecting absolute tuning differences between both object sets.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Altogether, I consider the work exceptional. The data make new and important contributions to understanding the cortical mechanisms underlying grasp control. By concurrently recording and characterising the relationships between limb kinematics and neural activity from AIP, F5, and M1 while monkeys viewed and grasped a wide range of objects, the scope of the current investigation is unparalleled in the current primate neurophysiological literature. Also outstanding are the beautiful data visualisation methods that the authors advance here.</italic> </p><p> <italic>I have a few suggestions, however, detailed below. My hope is that the authors will find these comments constructive.</italic> </p><p> <italic>A) Main concerns:</italic></p><p> <italic>(A-1) The role of AIP</italic> </p><p> <italic>I'm having some difficulty understanding the authors’ stance on the role of AIP. I believe they are arguing that their data suggest that AIP is encoding object properties in visual terms, and not in motoric terms. They suggest that the results of their CDA show that AIP encodes objects according to shape in visual space, independent of the way they are grasped.</italic> </p><p> <italic>My interpretation of their stance is that AIP activity does not reflect action possibilities in sensorimotor terms – but rather reflects the 'flagging' of visual features relevant for actions, but NOT (yet) represented as spatiomotor plans.</italic> </p><p> <italic>If this is indeed their stance, I see this as a significant departure from prior conceptualizations (Jeannerod et al., 1995).</italic> </p><p><italic>However, I remain confused about this argument, both (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib1\">1</xref>) conceptually, and (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib2\">2</xref>) with respect to how some aspects of their data can be viewed as consistent these claims.</italic></p><p>Thank you for your detailed thoughts that we found very constructive. Following your comments, we have clarified the interpretation/summary of AIP throughout the manuscript and highlighted the corresponding sections in green (see section “Vision for action”, paragraph 3 and 6, “Discussion”, paragraph 5-7). We hope that these revisions improve the general understanding of the AIP results and their interpretation. Here we first summarize our stance and then address point-by point your questions regarding concept and data:</p><p>Grasping an object in different ways does not only require different motor plans, but also differentiated visual descriptions of the object. For example, when grasping a coffee cup, we need to create a geometrical description of the cup and an additional visual selection of its object parts (e.g., the handle) that we intend to grasp (e.g., perform a hook grip). Our data suggests that AIP is a dynamical visual area that might be responsible for differentiating and selecting these objects parts in a visual (geometrical) rather than in a motor space.</p><p> <italic>1) Conceptually. The authors talk about &quot;object affordances&quot; as different from &quot;motor affordances&quot;.</italic> </p><p> <italic>To me, affordances = action possibilities; they are sensory representations of the external environment that are inseparably linked to the motor apparatus and capabilities of the perceiving animal. In other words, affordances are, according to my understanding, inextricably motor.</italic> </p><p> <italic>What does it mean to &quot;extract object affordances relevant for grasping&quot;, but to not at the same time encode those same objects according to the spatiomotor properties required for their manual interaction?</italic> </p><p> <italic>They state: &quot;…suggest encoding of object affordances rather than motor affordances&quot;.</italic> </p><p><italic>I urge the authors to better clarify what is meant by object vs. motor affordances.</italic></p><p>Your comment is directly related to comment (d) of Reviewer #2. With object affordances we intended to express the visual extraction of object features of an object part relevant for grasping. To avoid confusion, we replaced “object affordances” with “object features” throughout the manuscript.</p><p> <italic>2) Data. Some aspects of AIP data suggest encoding related to motoric features.</italic> </p><p> <italic>a) Shift for same object – big horizontal cylinders – when grasped from below vs. above.</italic></p><p><italic>b) Significant differentiation of conditions 00 vs. 01.</italic></p><p><italic>c) Motor similarity measures – <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig7\">Figure 7</xref> – presumably a measure of.75 for AIP is different than a measure of &quot;1&quot; – and thus, does suggest some correspondence between N- and J-space encoding in AIP</italic></p><p><italic>d) Also, there interpretation of <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref> vs. d – &quot;…observed encoding of abstract objects in AIP can be explained exclusively by object shape.&quot;</italic> </p><p> <italic>Is it not possible that these data may reflect the fact that abstract versus mixed object set have more graspable parts – a greater number of possible actions –, and AIP encoding is sensitive to these differences?</italic> </p><p> <italic>This account could be considered consistent with the authors’ interpretations regarding the evidence for reduced tuning in AIP over time for abstract shapes: &quot;…reduction of 3D shapes to the relevant parts for grasping…&quot;.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Summary:</italic></p><p> <italic>While the authors seem to argue for a strict separation in roles between AIP and F5 – visual vs. motor, respectively – I see the data as more likely evidence for a continuum – a graded difference – visual prevalence in AIP, with motor encoding vs. motoric prevalence in F5, with visual encoding.</italic> </p><p> <italic>I suggest that the authors clarify their stance, and/or temper their arguments.</italic> </p><p>Describing the neural differentiation in cases a-b as motor features would be seductive and in agreement with current literature. However, in our opinion, this standpoint does not reflect the global view on our data. For the following reasons we interpret the observed modulations in AIP as a visual rather than a motoric differentiation:</p><list list-type=\"bullet\"><list-item><p>In both animals, the AIP population separated objects primarily on visual object attributes at the session- (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2</xref>) and multi-session level (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s2\">2</xref>): objects clustered primarily based on visual attributes, such as shape and size, although they were grasped in highly different fashions. In contrast, motor attributes were rarely found.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Differences with respect to the selected grip type were only apparent when <italic>the same</italic> object was grasped differently (e.g., handle box, horizontal cylinder), whereas all other objects maintained their shape clusters. In contrast, motor feature coding, as observed in F5 and M1, would separate all objects in motor terms (not only those that offer different object parts). This could indicate visual rather than motor processes for grasping.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The separation of such conditions (handle, cylinder) originated from the same shape cluster (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig9\">Author response image 1</xref>) also suggesting visual rather than motor transformations.</p></list-item></list><fig id=\"fig9\" position=\"float\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.7554/eLife.15278.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Visualization of (<bold>a</bold>) reduced and (<bold>b</bold>) complete population show perfectly overlapping clusters of small (black triangles, 51-54) and large cylinders (red triangles, 55-56) in the early cue phase (100 ms after cue onset).</title><p>These conditions start separating over time as shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2e,f</xref>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type=\"doi\" xlink:href=\"10.7554/eLife.15278.022\">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15278.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype=\"x-tiff\" mimetype=\"image\" xlink:href=\"elife-15278-resp-fig1-v1\"/></fig><p>In d), the reviewer suggested that abstract objects might have more graspable parts, and hence a larger number of possible actions, than objects of the mixed set. However, we regard this as rather unlikely. Neither the grasp variability of both animals nor the visual aspect of the objects justifies the conclusion that abstract objects have more graspable parts. In fact, we specifically designed the abstract set such that objects have many different visual parts, but only one graspable part, which both animals also uniformly selected.</p><p>However, we agree with Reviewer #3 that the visual and motor space cannot be separated completely, as we have discussed previously (Schaffelhofer et al. 2015). For example, coming from the motor side, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6c-d</xref> shows the separation of objects based on the recorded hand kinematics. Although this is a pure motor representation of objects, some shapes tend to cluster together, such as the vertical cylinders or the cubes, due to the design of the objects that shape the hand. In other words, even a pure motor representation creates similarities with the visual space and vice versa.</p><p>Taken together, and in agreement with reviewer #3, the differences between AIP and F5 can only be described as graded ones, with visual prevalence in AIP and motoric prevalence in F5. While we maintain our general interpretation of the AIP results, we tempered our arguments, as suggested. Both, visual and motor separation of objects is now discussed in the Results and Discussion section (we highlighted all text edits in the manuscript with respect to this comment in green).</p><p>“Vision for hand action”, paragraph 3:</p><p>“Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) performed on these distance measures confirmed the findings of the CDA and revealed a clear clustering according to object shape during visual presentation of the object (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2e</xref>) that widely remained during movement execution, although with significantly shorter neural distances (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2f</xref>).”</p><p>“Vision for hand action”, paragraph 7:</p><p>“This reduced selectivity could indicate either motor or visual transformations that are both required for grasping: First, the abstract objects were grasped with the same hand configuration (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3d</xref>).

Rather, the evidence of bidirectional connections to F5 suggests that subpopulations in AIP exist that reflect feedback motor signals from F5.”</p><p>“These modulations could reflect either motor (Fagg and Arbib, 1998) or visual transformations required for grasping. […] These differentiation schemes support our hypothesis of visual rather than motor transformations in AIP.”</p><p><italic>B) Intermediate concerns</italic> </p><p><italic>B-1) in the Introduction, the authors state that prior work did not dissociate between visual and motor features. At first, I thought this was inconsistent with the work of Sakata and colleagues – describing visual dominant, visuomotor, and motor dominant cell types. I think some discussion of this work upfront, including how the current approach critically differs, would be helpful.</italic></p><p>Previous approaches separated neurons into visual, visuomotor and motor cells primarily based on their responses to objects in light or dark condition (activation or no activation). According to Sakata and co-workers, Motor dominant cells become activated during grasping and holding in both light and dark. They do not fire during object fixation. Visual-motor neurons discharge stronger during grasping in light than in the dark. Visual-dominant neurons discharge during object fixation and when grasping in light. Thus, the epoch of activation has been the main criteria for classification.</p><p>Our work took a significantly different approach by comparing the coding (modulation patterns) of neurons and of neuronal populations with respect to highly variable objects and the measured hand kinematics in order to separate visual from motor processes. Our work demonstrated that activations in visual epochs can reflect motor processing, whereas grasp modulation can reflect object geometries.</p><p>We followed your suggestion and entirely revised paragraph 4-6 of the Introduction:</p><p>“To create a deeper understanding of how visual information is transformed into motor commands, a precise identification and differentiation of visual and motor processes within the grasping network is required. […] Our data revealed distinct roles of the grasping network in translating visual object attributes (AIP) into planning (F5) and execution signals (M1) and allowed visualizing the propagation of these features for grasping. “</p><p> <italic>B-2) Introduction – last paragraph – it isn't clear to me what the authors mean to say here, without first reading the rest of the paper. I think this section could be made clearer.</italic> </p><p>We revised the last paragraph accordingly (see above). We believe, that the concept and intention of our experiments are now better explained.</p><p><italic>B-3) I'm not sure I understand their explanation of the shape-specificity prior to fixation. Please try to make this clearer.</italic></p><p>Shape-specificity during the fixation epoch is likely due to our block design, in which we presented objects of similar shape on the same turntable. This fact is a small detail, however it could raise concerns on whether coding in AIP was really due to object shape, or rather to the object presentation order (different turntables presented sequentially). We revised our arguments to make this clearer:</p><p>“The large number of objects presented in one recording session required separating the 48 objects on different turntables (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>), often objects of similar shape. This separation created small offsets already in the fixation epoch, but at very low modulations. An extreme case is shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2a</xref>. This might raise concerns on whether coding in AIP was really due to object shape, or rather to the object presentation order (different turntables presented sequentially). However, shape-wise clustering in AIP cannot be explained by the task design for the following reasons: (1) The offsets in the fixation epoch were very small in comparison to the visual modulations observed in AIP when the objects were presented (e.g., see <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media5\">Video 5</xref>). (2) The set of “mixed” objects – presented and grasped in the same block – clustered with other objects of the same shape (e.g. ring in mixed block clusters with other ring objects). Together, this demonstrates clear shape processing in AIP.”</p><p><italic>B-4) At first I thought I missed something – it seemed as though AIP was not looked at in terms of J- and N-space encoding in the same way that F5 and M1 were. However, later it is clear that they did analyse AIP in the same way. Why not also show these data, as they do for F5 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">5</xref>) and M1 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6</xref>)?</italic></p><p>For the complete N-space the AIP, F5, and M1 populations were analyzed and visualized in the same way. In the reduced space the areas were visualized differently to represent the full dimensional space (hierarchical clustering) best. That is, showing the object separation of AIP in 3D to reveal the object-shape clusters best, whereas F5 and M1 populations were shown in 2D and aligned (rotated) to the J-space (with PCRA) to allow direct comparison of both representations next to each other. We believe that this kind of visualization reflects and explains the full-dimensional results best.</p><p><italic>B-5) <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4</xref> – it is unclear to me why they plot J-space for the hold epoch and N-space for the grasp epoch; why not show results from the same epochs?</italic></p><p>Premotor area F5 provided higher modulations (separation of conditions) in the grasping epoch, when the hand was approaching the object. This is also shown and discussed in <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media5\">video 5</xref>, where you can see F5 expressions earlier than in M1. We therefore selected this epoch in area F5 to represent motor execution. However, all epochs, including the hold epoch, are shown below in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4i</xref>.</p><p><italic>B-6) <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref> – and the authors' discussion of the driving influence of F5 on M1 activity – how do these findings relate to (Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008)? I think these studies should be explicitly discussed.</italic></p><p>We find both studies most helpful. Umilta et al. and Spinks et al. report similarity between F5 and AIP with respect to grasp coding at the LFP and single unit level in support of our feature code correlation results. We now discuss and reference their work in the following sections:</p><p>Chapter “Feature coding in area M1”, first paragraph:</p><p>“In agreement with the general population response (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3b</xref>), single neurons of M1 were almost exclusively modulated during movement execution and showed minimal modulations during preparatory epochs (Umilita et al. 2007), as also indicated by the example neuron in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6a-b</xref>.”</p><p>“Discussion”, last paragraph:</p><p>“The high similarity of the F5 and M1 population during movement execution (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4h</xref> vs. 6e, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref>, and <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media5\">Video 5</xref>) is in agreement with findings of similar coding schemes between both areas in spiking (Umilta et al., 2007) and β-band LFP activity (Spinks et al., 2008).”</p><p> <italic>Also, is it not surprising to find so little evidence for correspondence between AIP and F5 during planning?</italic></p><p>The applied analysis reflects the coding similarity between both areas, not their physical connectivity. In other words, when two areas share the same feature coding with respect to the 50 conditions the correlation coefficient increases. In fact, the correlation analysis results, although exploring the data with an entirely different method, match the identified visual and motor coding (and their proportion) from the population analysis. In detail, only an F5 subpopulation coded objects in visual terms, and therefore similar with respect to AIP (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>). This explains the relatively low feature-communication peaks between both areas, and demonstrates that the coding of objects is represented strongly differently in AIP and F5 during large parts of the task, although both areas are highly modulated by these objects. Please note that we would expect significantly higher feature communication between AIP and F5 when precisely targeting the F5a subdivision, which holds predominantly visual-dominant neurons, in comparison to F5p (Theys et al. 2012), and directly receives information from AIP (Gerbella et al. 2010).</p><p>In response to your comment, we added the following sentences to chapter “Results/Feature code correlation”:</p><p>“These results are consistent with the proportion of F5 visual cells identified in animal Z and M (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>), which only temporarily shared the visual coding with AIP. Interestingly, F5 and AIP demonstrated minimal similarities during movement planning, which could support the different encoding of visual and motor features described on the population level (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">5</xref>).”</p><p><italic>How does the relationship between AIP and F5 that the authors suggest according to their new results compare with prior accounts – e.g. Jeannerod et al., 1995; Fagg and Arbib, 1998?</italic></p><p>Existing models of the grasping network share the same basic interpretation of the F5-AIP network as the main circuit for visuomotor transformation (Jeannerod et al., 1995, Fagg and Arbib, 1998, Rizzolati et Luppino, 2001). In support, our data provides important electrophysiological evidence that object features are indeed transformed into motor representations between both areas.</p><p>Previous models were, however, uncertain on how and where visual information is exactly translated into motor commands and whether both areas perform both visual and motor computations. Fagg et Arbib (1998) and Rizzolatti et Luppino (2001) consider grasp transforms already in AIP. They propose that AIP is using the visual input to generate multiple affordances passed to F5, which selects the final grip type.</p><p>Our data suggest a slightly different information flow in which visual and motor processes are organized more separately. In this understanding, AIP is responsible for providing object properties to F5 (F5a) thereby activating motor solutions that, in return to AIP, help further extracting geometrical features relevant for grasping. F5 with its connection to visual input (F5a) and motor output (F5p), could be the main hub for coordinating visual feature extraction with AIP and motor planning and subsequent execution with M1.</p><p>We believe that our edits in response to this reviewer’s comment a) (see above) addresses this question.</p><p> <italic>How do the authors interpret the increased AIP-M1 correspondence during grasp and hold?</italic> </p><p>This comment is related to comment (1b)-d. As discussed above, visual representations of objects and motor features of the hand cannot be entirely disassociated, because the object geometries define the shape of the grasping hand. Even pure motor representations, such as the recorded hand kinematics, can therefore share similarities with an object space. When M1 changes from a mostly unmodulated (planning) to a highly modulated state (grasp epoch) the similarity to an object space increases. In other words, we interpret the increase of similarity as a result of the highly increased modulations in M1.</p><p> <italic>B-7) What do the authors mean by the statement regarding M1 on p.26 &quot;…its neuronal population has never been studied explicitly&quot;? What about, for e.g., the work of Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008?</italic> </p><p>We tempered this statement: “Although the motor relevance of the hand area of M1 has been described extensively with electrophysiological (Schieber, 1991; Schieber and Poliakov, 1998; Spinks et al., 2008; Umilta et al., 2007) and anatomical methods (Dum and Strick, 2005; Rathelot and Strick, 2009), it has been unclear how versatile hand configurations are encoded at the population level.”</p></body></sub-article></article>\n",

genus Candida have high genetic variability and are the most common\r\n\t\t\t\t\topportunistic pathogenic fungi in humans. In this study, we evaluated the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgenetic diversity among 120 isolates of Candida spp. obtained from diabetic\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpatients, kidney transplant recipients and patients without any immune\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdeficiencies from Paraná state, Brazil. The analysis was performed using the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region and a partial sequence of 28S rDNA. In the phylogenetic\r\n\t\t\t\t\tanalysis, we observed a consistent separation of the species C. albicans, C.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdubliniensis, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. metapsilosis and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tC. orthopsilosis, however with low intraspecific variability. In the analysis of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe C. albicans species, two clades were formed. Clade A included the largest\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of isolates (91.2%) and the majority of isolates from GenBank (71.4%).\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe phylogenetic analysis showed low intraspecific genetic diversity, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgenetic polymorphisms between C. albicans isolates were similar to genetic\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdivergence found in other studies performed with isolates from Brazil. This low\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgenetic diversity of isolates can be explained by the geographic proximity of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe patients evaluated. It was observed that yeast colonisation was highest in\r\n\t\t\t\t\trenal transplant recipients and diabetic patients and that C. albicans was the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies most frequently isolated.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</abstract>\r\n\t\t\t<kwd-group xml:lang=\"en\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<title>Key words:</title>\r\n\t\t\t\t<kwd>ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and 28S rDNA</kwd>\r\n\t\t\t\t<kwd>Candida</kwd>\r\n\t\t\t\t<kwd>diabetes</kwd>\r\n\t\t\t\t<kwd>renal transplant recipient</kwd>\r\n\t\t\t</kwd-group>\r\n\t\t\t<funding-group>\r\n\t\t\t\t<award-group>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<funding-source>University of Chile</funding-source>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<award-id>1140824</award-id>\r\n\t\t\t\t</award-group>\r\n\t\t\t</funding-group>\r\n\t\t</article-meta>\r\n\t</front>\r\n\t<body>\r\n\t\t<p>Infections caused by opportunistic fungi, such as <italic>Candida</italic> yeast, often\r\n\t\t\taffect patients undergoing organ or bone marrow transplants, AIDS patients, patients\r\n\t\t\ttaking immunosuppressive drugs, patients undergoing cancer treatment, those having\r\n\t\t\tundergone major surgery, those of advanced age or premature infants (<xref\r\n\t\t\t\tref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">Anderson et al. 2007</xref>).

No se encontró asociación entre la aparición de PE en la actual gestación y\n        el antecedente de PE.

Se han estudiado estos parámetros entre la\n          11<sup>+0</sup>-13<sup>+6</sup> semanas.</p>\n      <p>Se han realizado muchos estudios analizando el desempeño de la historia clínica\n        materna, marcadores bioquímicos y biofísicos y su capacidad de predicción de PE en\n        primer trimestre. La historia clínica materna desempeña un papel importante en la\n        identificación de mujeres con alto riesgo de PE. Un estudio presentó tasas de\n        detección de PE precoz y tardía de 37,0 y 28,9%, respectivamente, para una tasa de\n        falsos positivos del 5%<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\"\n          >5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>\n      <p>Se hizo una anamnesis dirigida, y se obtuvo una tasa global de PE del 4,6% siendo la\n        tasa de PE tardía más alta que la PE temprana. Estos hallazgos se correlacionan con\n        los datos encontrados en la literatura en la cual la prevalencia de PE tardía es\n        significativamente mayor que la de PE precoz. El desarrollo de PE tardía se cree que\n        es influenciado por predisposición materna con escaso componente\n          placentario<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref><sup>),\n          (</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>\n      <p>Entre nuestras gestantes, el 0,6% presentaban DM pre-gestacional discrepando con la\n        prevalencia general de esta última del 2-5% en gestante<sup>(</sup><xref\n          ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>\n      <p>Basado en las características clínicas encontramos un 1,2% de pacientes con HTA\n        crónica con edad media de 33 años, dato que difiere con respecto a la prevalencia\n        general de HTAC en embarazo en gestantes de 30-39 años, resultado probablemente\n        secundario al bajo volumen obstétrico.</p>\n      <p>En nuestra población no se ha hallado asociación entre la nuliparidad y la aparición\n        de PE, dato que contrasta con la asociación importante entre estos dos últimos\n        descritos en la literatura<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\"\n          >7</xref><sup>)</sup>, lo que puede atribuirse a que la mayoría de nuestras\n        pacientes eran multíparas con período intergenésico menor a 10 años y sin factores\n        coexistentes que aumentaran su riesgo a presentar PE.</p>\n      <p>No se ha encontrado asociación entre el IMC y PE, ya que el IMC encontrado en nuestra\n        población fue de 23 y el IMC descrito en la literatura como factor predisponente a\n        presentar PE es de 30<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\"\n        >8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tampoco ha aparecido asociación entre PE tardía y antecedente\n        de PE previa, HTAC, DM pregestacional, trombofilias y TRA con respecto a lo\n        publicado en que se demuestra la asociación de estas condiciones preexistentes con\n        la aparición de PE precoz y no tardía<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\"\n          >1</xref><sup>)</sup>, <sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\"\n          >9</xref><sup>)</sup>, <sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\"\n          >3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>\n      <p>La literatura demuestra asociación de trombofilias con la aparición de PE precoz o\n          severa<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref><sup>)</sup> dato que\n        puede explicar la ausencia de asociación con nuestros casos de PE tardía.</p>\n      <p>En un estudio, se informó de que el uso de PAPP-A junto con marcadores biofísicos\n        puede detectar más de dos tercios de PE precoz y un tercio de los casos de PE tardía\n        cuando se clasifica el 2% de las gestaciones como de alto riesgo; tres cuartas\n        partes de PE precoz se pudieron detectar con tasa de falsos positivos del\n          5%<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. En nuestro\n        estudio los valores del IP AUt (11<sup>+0</sup>-13<sup>+6</sup>) y PAPP-A sérica no\n        mostraron individualmente asociación con la aparición de PE tardía.</p>\n      <p>En nuestro estudio no observamos asociación entre el IP AUt con PE tardía. El IP AUt\n        se relaciona con una placentación inadecuada, que puede explicar la aparición de PE\n        precoz y no tardía, ya que esta última es de etiología multifactorial más que\n        placentaria. El Doppler de las arterias uterinas en primer trimestre tiene una tasa\n        de detección para PE precoz (con un 10% de falsos positivos) del 81% cuando se\n        combina con factores maternos. Las tasas de detección respectivas para PE tardía\n        aumentaron del 41 a 45%<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\"\n          >9</xref><sup>)</sup>. En los últimos años se han construido algoritmos que\n        combinan todos estos factores, presentando tasas de detección de alrededor de 90%\n        para PE precoz y 60% para PE tardía<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\"\n          >10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nuestro trabajo no ha podido demostrar asociación entre\n        el IP AUt y la PE tardía. Con nuestros resultados hemos realizado la validación\n        externa del modelo predictivo de PE propuesto por el hospital Clinic de Barcelona,\n        respecto a la PE tardía, ya que solo obtuvimos un caso de PE temprana.</p>\n      <p>Antes de considerar si se debe utilizar un modelo de predicción clínica, se requiere\n        que su rendimiento predictivo haya sido evaluado en los conjuntos de datos que no se\n        utilizaron para construir el modelo, o sea realizar una validación externa.\n        Externamente la validación del modelo en un entorno geográfico diferente es una\n        buena medida de su generalización y exportabilidad<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n          rid=\"B5\">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muy pocos estudios han validado externamente\n        modelos de primer trimestre. Recientemente, el rendimiento de un algoritmo\n        desarrollado en el Reino Unido<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\"\n          >6</xref><sup>)</sup> se ha evaluado en una población\n          australiana<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref><sup>)</sup>,\n        mostrando una reducción en la tasa de detección del 83 al 41,7% con una tasa de\n        falsos positivos de 5% para la PE precoz, aunque el pequeño número de casos en la\n        cohorte de validación y las diferencias en las características de la población o las\n        técnicas de medición no permiten sacar conclusiones firmes sobre esta\n        diferencia.</p>\n      <p>Nuestro estudio apoya la validación externa de un modelo previamente construido de PE\n        tardía en una población diferente de bajo riesgo en un centro de bajo volumen\n        obstétrico, aunque el rendimiento es solo moderado en términos de tasa de detección.\n        Las tasas de detección para un 5, 10 y 15% de falsos positivos fueron 21,9, 31,4 y\n        38,6%. Al comparar las áreas bajo la curva de la cohorte de validación con la\n        cohorte de la construcción, no se encontraron diferencias estadísticamente\n        significativas (p=0,68). Desafortunadamente, el tamaño de nuestra muestra es muy\n        pequeña, haciendo difícil sacar conclusiones a partir de las curvas ROC.</p>\n      <p>Haga un clic para ver [<inline-supplementary-material mime-subtype=\"pdf\"\n          mimetype=\"application\" xlink:href=\"1137-6627-asisna-38-03-0387-suppl01.pdf\"\n          >Material Suplementario</inline-supplementary-material>].</p>\n      <p>La prevalencia de PE tardía es significativamente mayor que la de PE precoz. El\n        desarrollo de PE tardía se cree que está influenciada significativamente por la\n        predisposición materna con poco o insignificante componente placentario, lo que\n        explica una menor presencia de restricción de crecimiento intrauterino (RCIU) que se\n        produce en la mayoría de los casos de PE precoz; esto hace que la predicción de PE\n        tardía en el primer trimestre sea bastante desafiante. En el presente estudio, las\n        mujeres con PE tenían una edad gestacional menor al momento del parto 37,9 [DS 1,45]\n        frente a 39,2 [DS 1,44]; p = 0,016, lo que refleja una mayor incidencia de la\n        inducción del parto debido a la aparición de PE como criterio de finalización de la\n        gestación. Los beneficios de la predicción de PE tardía se sustentan indirectamente\n        por un ensayo clínico aleatorio que demuestra que la inducción electiva a las 37\n        semanas mejora los resultados maternos sin ningún empeoramiento en los resultados\n        neonatales. Consultar <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"t2\">Figura 5</xref>\n      </p>\n      <p>Reconocemos que una limitación importante de nuestro estudio es el tamaño de la\n        muestra debido a que se desarrolló en un centro privado con bajo volumen obstétrico\n        y gestantes de bajo riesgo; esto no nos permitió poder analizar el rendimiento del\n        modelo para predecir la PE precoz. Recientemente, se ha publicado otro algoritmo por\n        el mismo grupo que incluía factores angiogénicos en primer trimestre, que muestra\n        una mejoría relevante en la tasa de detección de PE tardía (69% con una tasa de\n        falsos positivos del 10%). Lamentablemente, carecemos de datos sobre los factores\n        angiogénicos en el algoritmo para probar la validez de este modelo.</p>\n      <p>Concluimos que la combinación de la historia clínica materna, la PAPP-A sérica y la\n        PAM medida en primer trimestre es moderadamente útil para predecir PE en gestantes\n        de bajo riesgo obstétrico en un centro de bajo volumen.</p>\n      <p>Consideramos que el modelo predictivo del hospital Clinic de Barcelona es una\n        herramienta válida para predecir la aparición de PE tardía en centros de bajo\n        volumen obstétrico.</p>\n    </sec>\n  </body>\n  <back>\n    <app-group>\n      <app id=\"app1\">\n        <label>Apéndice I</label>\n        <table-wrap id=\"t2\">\n          <label>Figura 5</label>\n

A total of 295 children aged 6 to 60 months\n          participated in this cohort conducted from August 2007 to December 2008. They\n          were diagnosed and monitored by the referral service of the state. Interviews\n          were made with families to identify sociodemographic variables, and an oral exam\n          was performed to determine dental caries. The SRQ (Self Report Questionnaire)\n          scale was used to diagnose the presence of common mental disorders, and the CAGE\n          (Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty and Eye opener) was applied to determine abusive use\n          of alcohol. The absolute and relative frequencies of the variables of interest\n          were analyzed by Chi-square and Mann-Whitney, with a 5% significance level. The\n          incidence variables were analyzed according to the logistic regression model,\n          with a confidence interval of 95%. Caries incidence (1.98; SD = 4.68) was higher\n          in the HbSS genotype. There was a statistically significant association between\n          caries incidence and both abusive use of alcohol (32.43%, RR = 1.99; 1.05-3.78;\n          95%CI) and common mental disorders (8.77% RR = 0.37; 0.15-0.93; 95%CI). There\n          was also an association between caries incidence and maternal risk behavior,\n          indicating that the care network should be expanded to include patients with\n          sickle cell disease.</p>\n      </abstract>\n      <kwd-group xml:lang=\"en\">\n        <title>Key words:</title>\n        <kwd>Oral Health</kwd>\n        <kwd>Dental Caries</kwd>\n        <kwd>Anemia</kwd>\n        <kwd>Sickle Cell</kwd>\n        <kwd>Cohort Studies</kwd>\n      </kwd-group>\n    </article-meta>\n  </front>\n  <body>\n    <sec sec-type=\"intro\">\n      <title>Introduction</title>\n      <p>Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is the most prevalent hemoglobinopathy in\n          Brazil<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.

In\n        the National Oral Health Survey (SB Brazil) of 2003, <sup>(</sup><xref\n          ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref><sup>)</sup> the mean dmft for healthy\n        Brazilian children aged 18-36 months was 1.07 (SD = 2.40) and 1.00 (SD = 2.24) in\n        the northeast region. As for the 5 year-old age group, the dmft recorded in the SB\n        Brazil 2010<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref><sup>)</sup> was 2.43\n        (95%CI 2.22-2.63) for the country and 1.70 (95%CI 1.36-2.04) for the city of\n        Salvador, the Bahia state capital where the research was conducted. In the present\n        study, the dmft of the follow-up group (2.69, SD = 5.23) was higher than that of\n        Brazil and that of Bahia.</p>\n      <p>According to the literature, <sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\"\n          >2</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref><sup>)</sup>\n        sickle cell disease does not predispose individuals to caries, at least not\n        directly. In the two articles found in the literature referred to above, there was\n        no statistically significant association between caries incidence and genotype. HbSS\n        showed a higher caries incidence, as was observed in other studies with\n          adults<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref\n          ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref><sup>)</sup> and adolescents, <sup>(</sup><xref\n          ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref><sup>)</sup> as compared with the HbSC\n        genotype and control groups. Ralstrom<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\"\n          >1</xref><sup>)</sup> attributed this association to the lower severity of\n        clinical manifestations of the HbSC <italic>versus</italic> the HbSS genotype.</p>\n      <p>Despite the lack of association between the incidence of caries and the genotype for\n        more severe disease, it was found that the morbidity for pain crises was a risk\n        factor for caries incidence. Pain crisis is the most common clinical event and the\n        primary reason for seeking medical services and hospitalization; <sup>(</sup><xref\n          ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref><sup>)</sup> for this reason, the children\n        reporting this symptom in this study were considered as having a greater degree of\n        severity than those who never presented it. Pain crisis was the event that most\n        contributed to a greater burden of disease on Cameroonian parents. <sup>(</sup><xref\n          ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref><sup>)</sup>\n      </p>\n      <p>In respect to this severe clinical profile, Guimarães and collaborators, in their\n        study on the daily lives of families of children and adolescents with sickle cell\n        disease, reported that mothers tend to be overprotective and burdened when they need\n        to spend time caring for their children and have to give up social functions. An\n        impact on the family environment was also reported in this study, namely the\n        inability to accept the disease and the fear of death, to the extent that the family\n        experienced periods of greater or lesser control of the disease and could not handle\n        the situation, feeling lost and hopeless.</p>\n      <p>According to Martin and Angelo, <sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\"\n          >7</xref><sup>)</sup> the mother is largely responsible for family health in\n        low-income communities, since she represents the center of the family. It is the\n        mother who plays the leading role in controlling important variables which determine\n        caries, such as eating habits and oral hygiene. Accordingly, the variables related\n        to maternal behavior - the presence of common mental disorders and alcohol abuse -\n        are important factors in constructing the family context. In this study, maternal\n        risk behavior variables were associated with caries incidence. This goes to show how\n        family background affects the oral health of these children.</p>\n      <p>Sousa <italic>et al</italic>. also found an association between family dysfunction,\n        resulting from common maternal mental disorder symptoms and alcoholism, and the\n        incidence of caries in children aged 2-3 years with a dmft of 0.72 (SD = 1.8). </p>\n      <p>It has been suggested that sickle cell disease, its social representations and its\n        clinical symptoms, which tend to worsen with age, are factors that trigger and/or\n        contribute to building a negative family environment, and, consequently, to a\n        worsening in oral health.</p>\n      <p>Despite the relevance of sickle cell disease to the general and oral health of\n        stricken children, the limitations of this study are worth noting, including the\n        convenience of the sample, which consisted of those requiring health services and\n        already receiving medical and dental care. As a result, it is important to note that\n        the sample does not allow inference of these results to all patients with sickle\n        cell disease, only to the sample population.</p>\n      <p>Another consideration is that that sample size represented not only a limitation, but\n        also a difficulty, since case follow-up was dependent on the patients’ return for a\n        follow-up appointment with the hematologist. Thus, the sample may not have been\n        enough for some variables to become more expressive. Furthermore, the strategy of\n        bivariate analysis for caries incidence was adopted because caries was the most\n        important oral manifestation, but further studies should not discard the existence\n        of other associations.</p>\n    </sec>\n    <sec sec-type=\"conclusions\">\n      <title>Conclusions</title>\n      <p>In this sample, an association between the incidence of caries and maternal behavior\n        (alcohol abuse, maternal depression) was verified. The results also give indications\n        of the association between sickle cell disease severity and a higher caries\n        incidence, a finding that should be followed up in subsequent studies to confirm\n        this relationship.</p>\n      <p>The significant loss of patients between the baseline and the follow-up suggests that\n        there may be significant barriers in accessing the state’s referral center. Studies\n        on the access to these services still lack in the literature, indicating that\n        further evaluation is required.</p>\n    </sec>\n  </body>\n  <back>\n    <ack>\n      <title>Acknowledgments</title>\n      <p>We would like to thank <italic>Associação dos Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais</italic>\n        - APAE/Salvador for their support and collaboration.

Lo anterior debe ser leído\n      también a la luz de los crecientes incentivos dados a los investigadores y a las\n      unidades académicas a las que pertenecen, que no solo fomentan, sino que instan a la\n      publicación de sus trabajos en revistas científicas, especialmente si estas se\n      encuentran indexadas. Dichos incentivos, provenientes tanto de las propias unidades\n      académicas, como de órganos estatales a los cuales se les designa la tarea del fomento\n      de la investigación y de acreditación de los diversos programas ofrecidos por los\n      centros de educación, parecen ajustarse a la idea de que este tipo de publicaciones no\n      solo otorgan una mayor visibilidad (y, esperablemente, un mayor impacto) del contenido y\n      conclusiones a las que arriban los autores, sino también un proceso editorial que sea lo\n      suficientemente asertivo, transparente y profesional como para dar lugar a la\n      publicación de trabajos con mayor calidad, asegurando el cumplimiento de ciertos\n      estándares objetivos conocidos por la comunidad científica.</p>\n    <p>Sobre el particular, quisiera detenerme en uno de los aspectos que ha concitado una\n      lectura más detenida en los últimos tiempos en relación con la formulación del proceso\n      editorial cuyos objetivos fundamentales fueron previamente descritos. Este hace alusión\n      a los criterios éticos que se imponen a los autores y que, aunque pueden ser\n      subentendidos de las normas editoriales, probablemente requieren de un mayor detalle y\n      explicitación.</p>\n    <p>En el contexto mundial se han organizado instancias de encuentro y análisis de este tipo\n      de problemas, como el Commitee on Publication Ethics (COPE), creado por un grupo de\n      editores de revistas médicas del Reino Unido, que pretende otorgar asesoría e\n      información respecto a los diversos aspectos éticos involucrados en las publicaciones de\n      carácter académico, especialmente en lo que se refiere a la forma en que estos deben ser\n      abordados. Asimismo, se encuentran presentes en las directrices desarrolladas por el\n      International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), haciendo uso de una\n      concepción amplia de conductas reñidas con la ética científica, incluyendo, sin\n      limitación, la fabricación y la falsificación de datos y el plagio. Así, los criterios\n      éticos para el análisis de las publicaciones científicas pretenden abordar diversos\n      aspectos, del todo heterogéneos, pero que apuntan a que el artículo en cuestión\n      efectivamente dé cuenta de un trabajo original, en el que se pueda atestiguar la real\n      vinculación del autor y de su contenido y en que el uso del material bibliográfico,\n      empírico o histórico utilizado sea fi dedigno.</p>\n    <p>La labor de revisión de estos puntos, en los que claramente incide la solicitud dada a\n      los pares en el proceso de evaluación, debe pasar preliminarmente por un compromiso\n      ético asumido por el autor desde el momento preciso en el que somete el trabajo para dar\n      curso al proceso editorial y que debe mantenerse en todas sus etapas, sobreviviendo,\n      incluso, a su eventual publicación. De no ser de este modo, el peso impuesto a los\n      árbitros y a quienes desempeñan labores editoriales puede resultar desproporcionado si\n      no se parte de la premisa de que el autor o autores entienden y asumen el contenido del\n      deber ético antes señalado, como asimismo las consecuencias que su vulneración puede\n      acarrear.</p>\n    <p>Desde el punto de vista ético, la doctrina especializada ha avanzado bastante en el punto\n      referido al plagio. De ello se ha escrito también en nuestras páginas<sup>1</sup>.\n      Situación que, por de pronto, aparece como una de las más graves desde esta perspectiva,\n      pudiendo llevar incluso a responsabilidades legales derivadas de la infracción de las\n      normas de la propiedad intelectual (en nuestro país, Ley No. 17.336, de propiedad\n      intelectual). No obstante, los estándares éticos no se resumen en la utilización sin\n      cita de obras de otros autores, ni en la reutilización indiscriminada de los argumentos\n      de otros en la construcción de la propia obra sin añadir elementos de novedad para el\n      avance científico, sino que contempla otros tantos elementos para verificar también la\n      originalidad del trabajo. Así, en un mundo sumido en la vorágine tecnológica en la que\n      actualmente nos situamos, en la que nuestras observaciones, comentarios y argumentos\n      pueden encontrarse fácilmente accesibles por una diversidad de medios, el estándar de la\n      originalidad implica también la ausencia de los denominados autoplagios o, en otras\n      palabras, la utilización de textos, argumentos o conclusiones ya expresados en otras\n      sedes, a las cuales no se les une un desarrollo original. No implica lo anterior que los\n      autores no puedan insistir en sus líneas de investigación ni que puedan intentar abordar\n      el objeto de sus estudios desde múltiples perspectivas, sino que el reproche se produce\n      por la ausencia de toda novedad en sus postulados que resta importancia a las\n      publicaciones como medio de difusión científica para el desarrollo de la ciencia.</p>\n    <p>Otro tanto ocurre por medio de la utilización de material no consultado (v.gr.,\n      utilizando citas a documentos no consultados directamente, cuando ello es ciertamente\n      posible o inexcusable) o a la creación de material que no se ha ajustado a las máximas\n      de la ciencia, en especial, en lo que se refiere a la forma de obtención de material\n      para la fundamentación de los argumentos. Aquí, el reproche ético pasa desde la falta de\n      esmero en el desarrollo de la investigación, llegando, en sus estados más graves, al\n      mero invento de dicho material a efectos de poder sustentar antojadizamente una\n      conclusión. En estos supuestos, la vulneración de estos estándares puede producir un\n      enorme daño al avance de la ciencia, puesto que supone una menor o una completa ausencia\n      de honestidad intelectual, que puede derivar en desarrollos inadecuados por parte de\n      futuros lectores, sean éstos investigadores que pretenden el avance sobre conclusiones\n      previamente cimentadas sobre bases inciertas, sean, en nuestro caso, académicos, jueces\n      o abogados que diseñan teorías sobre trabajos que supuestamente gozan de rigor\n      intelectual.</p>\n    <p>Asimismo, la experiencia editorial comparada también ha dado cuenta de otros problemas\n      que pasan por la ausencia del compromiso real por parte de los autores de someter sus\n      trabajos a una única sede de revisión (al menos por el tiempo en que transcurre el\n      proceso editorial), de manera que se produce una asignación inadecuada y una redundancia\n      de gastos. Obsérvese, sobre este punto, que en nuestro entorno la solicitud del autor\n      para someter el trabajo a su revisión resulta gratuita para el autor, pero no\n      necesariamente para la publicación científica. Aquí, la norma ética no se presenta en\n      igual magnitud que en los casos anteriormente indicados, sino que se refleja en una\n      pérdida que el autor no asume por el incumplimiento de su compromiso original.</p>\n    <p>Todos estos elementos, que, como hemos indicado, parecen formar parte de la lógica\n      editorial más elemental, pueden resultar algo difusos en su aplicación práctica y en el\n      deslinde en aquellos casos en los que parecemos encontrarnos en zonas grises (v.gr.,\n      cuando se solicita añadir nuevos autores cuando el trabajo ya ha sido aceptado, o\n      eliminar a alguno de ellos en iguales circunstancias). En razón de lo anterior, nos\n      parece adecuado que el propio autor lleve a cabo un examen interno de su labor\n      investigativa y de los resultados a ser presentados, comprendiendo el impacto que su\n      trabajo puede tener tanto en el desarrollo del proceso editorial antes descrito, como en\n      la comunidad científica y en la sociedad en general.</p>\n    <p>Como Revista Chilena de Derecho, declaramos que se trata de un aspecto que nos ha\n      interesado recalcar, motivo por el cual se ha trabajado en la complementación de\n      nuestras normas editoriales plasmando los criterios antes indicados, pero siempre\n      considerando que se trata esta de una invitación a que los trabajos que puedan ser\n      publicados en nuestras páginas mantengan el rigor científico e intelectual que de ellas\n      se espera. Creemos que este es un medio para que el objetivo planteado para la revista\n      pueda efectivamente llevarse a cabo.</p>\n    <sig-block>Juan Luis Goldenberg Serrano<break/> Pontifícia Universidad Católica de\n      Chile</sig-block>\n  </body>\n</article>\n",

determinar la intensidad del daño de\n          Retinia arizonensis y su posible relación con algunos parámetros estructurales:\n          diámetro de tallo, altura y cobertura, así como con la regeneración natural de\n          los pinos piñoneros Pinus cembroides y P. nelsonii. Para su evaluación se\n          ubicaron sitios de 2,500 m<sup>2</sup> de cada especie; en P. cembroides se\n          contabilizaron 136 individuos de los cuales 135 presentaron un daño promedio de\n          10.5% (&#x00b1;8.1 D.E.) en brotes terminales. En P. nelsonii de un total de 47\n          individuos encontrados, 46 exhibieron daños por R. arizonensis, con un promedio\n          de 4.8% (&#x00b1;4.5 D.E.), ca 2 veces menos que en P. cembroides. Al realizar\n          la prueba de Kruskal-Wallis (H-Chi<sup>2</sup>) del porcentaje de daño de R.\n          arizonensis entre las especies, se observó marcada diferencia significativa (p\n          &lt; 0.001). Referente a la estructura, P. cembroides presentó los siguientes\n          valores promedio: diámetro del tallo = 10.7 cm (&#x00b1;8.0 D.E.), altura = 2.9\n          m (&#x00b1;1.0 D.E.) y cobertura = 3.0 m<sup>2</sup> (&#x00b1;1.8 D.E.). En\n          relación a P. nelsonii, los valores promedio fueron: diámetro del tallo = 10.7\n          cm (&#x00b1;4.3), altura = 3.6 m (&#x00b1;0.8) y cobertura = 4.2 m<sup>2</sup>\n          (&#x00b1;1.8), estas variables mostraron una amplia diferencia estadística (p\n          &lt; 0.001). Al medir la asociación del daño por R. arizonensis con las\n          variables estructurales, P. cembroides mostró correlación positiva marginal con\n          las variables altura, diámetro y cobertura con r<sup>2</sup> = 0.12, 0.16 y\n          0.18, respectivamente (p &lt; 0.001). Sin embargo, P. nelsonii no manifestó\n          correlación significativa entre el daño por R. arizonensis con los parámetros\n          estructurales. La influencia conjunta de las tres variables estructurales\n          (correlación múltiple r<sup>2</sup>) en el daño de R. arizonensis, quedó\n          mayormente explicada en P. cembroides con valor de r<sup>2</sup> de 0.19 como\n          altamente significativa (p &lt; 0.001). Para P. nelsonii la influencia de las\n          variables estructurales sobre el porcentaje de daño de R. arizonensis no fue\n          significativa (p = 0.128). La regeneración presentó una participación porcentual\n          (con respecto a los adultos) de 20.6% para P. cembroides y de 42.5% para P.\n          nelsonii, con altura promedio de 13.9 cm (&#x00b1;12.6) y 28.4 cm (&#x00b1;20.0)\n          en P. cembroides y P. nelsonii, respectivamente.</p>\n      </abstract>\n      <trans-abstract xml:lang=\"en\">\n        <title>ABSTRACT:</title>\n        <p>The present study aims to determine the damage intensity of the pinyon pitch\n          nodule moth, Retinia arizonensis and their possible relationship to some\n          structural parameters: stem diameter, height and coverage, as well as the\n          natural regeneration of Pinus cembroides and P. nelsonii. For their evaluation,\n          sites with 2,500 m<sup>2</sup> of each species were located. A total of 136\n          individuals of P. cembroides were recorded, with an average damage of 10.5%\n          (&#x00b1;8.1 SD) in the terminal buds. In P. nelsonii, a total of 47 individuals\n          were found, 46 exhibited damage from R. arizonensis, averaging 4.8% (&#x00b1;4.5\n          SD), twice less than P. cembroides. We used the Kruskal-Wallis\n            (H-Chi<sup>2</sup>) to assess the damage of R. arizonensis between species,\n          marked significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) was observed. Relating to the\n          structure, P. cembroides showed the following mean values: stem diameter = 10.7\n          cm (&#x00b1;8.0 SD), height = 2.9 m (&#x00b1;1.0 SD) and coverage = 3.0\n            m<sup>2</sup> (&#x00b1;1.8 SD). With respect to P. nelsonii, these were:\n          stem diameter = 10.7 cm (&#x00b1;4.3), height = 3.6 m (&#x00b1;0.8) and coverage\n            m<sup>2</sup> = 4.2 (&#x00b1;1.8), these variables showed wide statistical\n          differences (p &lt; 0.001). When measuring the association of R. arizonensis\n          damage, with the structural variables, P. cembroides showed a positive marginal\n          correlation with the variables height, diameter and covering with r<sup>2</sup>\n          = 0.12, 0.16 and 0.18, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). However, P. nelsonii\n          expressed non-significant correlations among R. arizonensis damage with the\n          structural parameters. The combined influence of the three structural variables\n          (multiple correlation r<sup>2</sup>) of R. arizonensis damage, was mostly\n          explained in P. cembroides with r<sup>2</sup> value of 0.19 highly significant\n          (p &lt; 0.001). In relation to P. nelsonii, the structural variables influenced\n          on damage percentage of R. arizonensis were not significant (p = 0.128).

Se estima\n        que la intensidad y la ocurrencia del daño dependen de varios factores inherentes\n        del hospedante, tales como el diámetro del tallo (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\"\n          >Jactel et al. 1996</xref>), la edad, la condición del vigor/estrés y la\n        presencia de compuestos volátiles químicos atrayentes o defensivos. Estos\n        compuestos, son producidos principalmente en las flores, pero también se encuentran\n        en los frutos, tallos, hojas y raíces. Los árboles de mayor dimensión, son más\n        fáciles de ser detectados por los herbívoros que los más pequeños, según “per se\n        size hypothesis” y la Teoría En Tamaulipas, aun cuando existen datos sobre la\n        distribución potencial de Retinia arizonensis para la región de Miquihuana, no hay\n        registros en la literatura especializada sobre el nivel daño que causa R.\n        arizonensis sobre pinos piñoneros. Sin embargo, durante el periodo\n        septiembre-noviembre del año 2012, se presentaron daños de R. arizonensis sobre los\n        brotes terminales de las dos especies piñoneras. Generando con ello, la necesidad de\n        conocer la dinámica de la interacción ecológica planta-herbívoro y el efecto que la\n        herbivoría causa sobre los pinos piñoneros así como <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\"\n          >Franklin &amp; Van Pelt (2004)</xref>.</p>\n      <p>Retinia arizonensis es una palomilla Lepidoptera de la familia Tortricidae, cuyo daño\n        consiste en barrenar brotes y conos. El adulto deposita de 1 a 3 huevecillos en la\n        base de las brácteas aciculares del brote en crecimiento, al emerger la larva se\n        alimenta del cambium formando galerías (sin daño aparente). El daño se observa a\n        principios de otoño, cuando las ramillas mueren y dan una apariencia de bandera\n        roja. Las larvas son de rojizo-amarillento con cabeza bien desarrollada. Durante el\n        invierno se forma una cámara de resina donde entra en diapausa, reiniciando su\n        actividad en primavera.

La investigación se desarrolló durante Septiembre\n        del 2012 en el Municipio de Miquihuana, Tamaulipas, situado en la región norte de la\n        Sierra Madre Oriental entre los paralelos 23° 47’ y 23° 24’ de latitud Norte y los\n        meridianos 99° 58’ y 99° 35’ de longitud Oeste, con una altitud entre 1,300 y 3,600\n        m snm (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">Jacobi &amp; Cranshaw, 2009</xref>). El uso\n        potencial del suelo y la vegetación está representado por: agricultura 8.4%, zona\n        urbana 0.2%, bosque 62.4%, matorral 27% y pastizal 2% (INEGI 2009). Los suelos son\n        relativamente homogéneos y pobres en materia orgánica (6.5%) con profundidad &lt;50\n        cm y pH entre 6.88.0 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">Brasil, 1996</xref>).</p>\n      <p>Un aspecto elemental de los bosques es la estructura, la cual incluye la variedad de\n        disposiciones o arreglos individuales (vertical y horizontal) y espaciales. En lo\n        individual, se consideran registros de diversos tamaños y condiciones de árboles y\n        tallos. En lo espacial, se refiere a la disposición de estos individuos, es decir,\n        si están uniformemente espaciados o agrupados. Estas características estructurales\n        de los bosques, cada vez son más reconocidas y estudiadas por teóricos y prácticos,\n        ya que es un conocimiento básico para el desarrollo adecuado de planes de manejo,\n        para mantener la sanidad e implementar medidas, para reducir la susceptibilidad a\n        los incendios, entre otras aplicaciones. En Miquihuana, se han realizado algunos\n        trabajos sobre este aspecto, pero se carece de estudios concernientes a la\n        asociación de los herbívoros con respecto a la estructura de estas especies, mismos\n        que permitirán reconocer las características ecológicas y adaptativas de ambos\n        interactuantes (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">SEDUMA, 2013</xref>).</p>\n      <p>El presente estudio, tuvo como objetivo central determinar la intensidad del daño de\n        Retinia arizonensis y su posible relación con tres parámetros estructurales\n        (diámetro de tallo, altura y cobertura), así como con la regeneración natural de P.\n        cembroides y P. nelsonii, en la región piñonera de Miquihuana, Tamaulipas. Una\n        aplicación práctica de estos resultados, es prevenir la expansión de daños en ambas\n        especies, para advertir a las autoridades fitosanitarias del municipio y del estado\n        sobre el mantenimiento del ecosistema, en términos del funcionamiento y la\n        sanidad.</p>\n      <p>El bosque piñonero se encuentra en un clima Bsohwx, seco semicálido, con una\n        precipitación promedio anual de 362.6 mm.

Para P. nelsonii el\n        comportamiento del daño es similar a P. cembroides, debido a que del total de\n        individuos (47), sólo uno se encontró en estado sano y ca 98% mostró algún nivel de\n        daño. Aun cuando las dos especies mostraron daño por R. arizonensis, para P.\n        cembroides el arbolado dañado (83%) se concentró en las primeras tres categorías (de\n        1 a 17.7%). Para P. nelsonii este mismo porcentaje de daño (83%) se agrupó en la\n        categoría 1 (de 1 a 6.6%) (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"t1\">Tablas 1</xref> y <xref\n          ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"t2\">2</xref>).</p>\n      <p>Resultados obtenidos por otros investigadores, sobre el daño que este insecto causa\n        sobre las especies piñoneras muestran lo siguiente: i) los bosques piñoneros (P.\n        cembroides) de Saltillo, Coahuila, México, presentaron ~80% de daño, causando una\n        mortalidad de ca 50% (Flores &amp; Morales 1985), ii) en la misma región, los\n        ataques severos y consecutivos de R. arizonensis adicionales a otros agentes nocivos\n        (e.g. plagas, sequías) causaron la muerte del 36% de las plantas bajo un sistema de\n        plantación comercial (Domínguez 2003), iii) otro hallazgo sobre el detrimento que\n        esta palomilla causa sobre P. cembroides, es el registrado en Cardonal, Hidalgo,\n        donde 55.6% de las ramillas terminales de los piñoneros presentaron mortalidad\n        (Morales 2013). Estos resultados son contrastantes con los obtenidos en el presente\n        estudio, donde los niveles de daño fueron desde 1.2 hasta 42 veces más, respecto a\n        los sitios mencionados.</p>\n      <p>\n        <disp-quote>\n          <p>“Con tu frente en mi frente,</p>\n          <p>con tu boca en mi boca,</p>\n          <p>atados nuestros cuerpos</p>\n          <p>al amor que nos quema,</p>\n          <p>deja que el viento pase</p>\n          <p>sin que pueda llevarme.”</p>\n          <p>Pablo Neruda</p>\n        </disp-quote>\n      </p>\n      <p>Densidad y estructura: La densidad encontrada para Pinus cembroides fue de 136\n        individuos (ca 3 veces más respecto a P. nelsonii con 47), esta especie mostró una\n        marcada uniformidad en todas las categorías diamétricas de los tallos. En contraste\n        con P. nelsonii, la distribución diamétrica se ubicó en las primeras cuatro clases,\n        exhibiendo menores valores de rango, ámbito y desviación estándar (<xref\n          ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"t3\">Tablas 3</xref> y <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"t4\"\n          >4</xref>).</p>\n      <p>De acuerdo a las clases diamétricas, en las dos especies se consideran bosques\n        jóvenes ya que concentran su población en las primeras clases diamétricas,\n        presentando forma de “J invertida” en P. cembroides (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f1\"\n          >Figura 1</xref>). Estas discrepancias categóricas, observadas principalmente en\n        P. nelsonii, posiblemente se deban a la presencia de factores adversos como las\n        sequías y la colecta excesiva de semillas; resultados similares fueron obtenidos en\n        P. nelsonii, P. cembroides y P. pinceana <inline-formula>\n          <mml:math id=\"e2\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n            <mml:semantics definitionURL=\"\" encoding=\"\">\n              <mml:mstyle>\n                <mml:mrow>\n                  <mml:munder>\n                    <mml:mo>&#x2211;</mml:mo>\n                    <mml:mrow>\n                      <mml:mi>i</mml:mi>\n                      <mml:mo mathsize=\"50.0%\">&#x2208;</mml:mo>\n                      <mml:mi>S</mml:mi>\n                    </mml:mrow>\n                  </mml:munder>\n                  <mml:mrow>\n                    <mml:mo mathvariant=\"italic\">&#x03c0;</mml:mo>\n                    <mml:mi>i</mml:mi>\n                    <mml:mo>=</mml:mo>\n                    <mml:mn>1</mml:mn>\n                  </mml:mrow>\n                </mml:mrow>\n              </mml:mstyle>\n            </mml:semantics>\n          </mml:math>\n        </inline-formula>. Igualmente, en las categorías diamétricas &gt;23.1 cm, P.\n        nelsonii está ausente, éste es un factor ecológico que en el futuro podría limitar\n        su regeneración y, por lo tanto, la deriva genética, afectando la adaptación y el\n        éxito de la especie. Este aspecto se constata con la nominación de P. nelsonii como\n        especie en peligro de extinción por la Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-059-SEMARNAT2010 y\n        como vulnerable según criterios de la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la\n        Naturaleza. En contraposición, P. cembroides que, aún cuando el porcentaje de\n        plantas es bajo (8.1%) en esta categoría, mantiene árboles en todas las categorías\n        diamétricas, lo cual fundamenta y expresa que la adaptación al medio está regida por\n        una sucesión multigeneracional, donde la posibilidad del éxito reproductivo está\n        garantizado y la especie no presenta riesgos mediatos de supresión ecológica (<xref\n          ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"t4\">Tabla 4</xref> y <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f1\">Figura\n          1</xref>) <inline-formula>\n          <mml:math id=\"e3\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n            <mml:semantics definitionURL=\"\" encoding=\"\">\n              <mml:mstyle>\n                <mml:mi>P</mml:mi>\n                <mml:mfenced close=\"}\" open=\"{\">\n                  <mml:mrow>\n                    <mml:msub>\n                      <mml:mi>K</mml:mi>\n                      <mml:mi>r</mml:mi>\n                    </mml:msub>\n                    <mml:mo>&#x2265;</mml:mo>\n                    <mml:mi>X</mml:mi>\n                    <mml:mo>+</mml:mo>\n                    <mml:mi>S</mml:mi>\n                    <mml:mi>(</mml:mi>\n                    <mml:mi>r</mml:mi>\n                    <mml:mi>)</mml:mi>\n                  </mml:mrow>\n                </mml:mfenced>\n                <mml:mo>&#x2264;</mml:mo>\n                <mml:mfrac>\n                  <mml:mrow>\n                    <mml:mi>E</mml:mi>\n                    <mml:mfenced close=\"]\" open=\"[\">\n                      <mml:msub>\n                        <mml:mi>K</mml:mi>\n                        <mml:mi>r</mml:mi>\n                      </mml:msub>\n                    </mml:mfenced>\n                  </mml:mrow>\n                  <mml:mrow>\n                    <mml:mi>X</mml:mi>\n                    <mml:mo>+</mml:mo>\n                    <mml:mi>S</mml:mi>\n                    <mml:mi>(</mml:mi>\n                    <mml:mi>r</mml:mi>\n                    <mml:mi>)</mml:mi>\n                  </mml:mrow>\n                </mml:mfrac>\n              </mml:mstyle>\n            </mml:semantics>\n          </mml:math>\n        </inline-formula> .</p>\n      <p>Asociación del daño por Retinia arizonensis con las variables estructurales. Respecto\n        a la influencia de las variables dasométricas sobre el daño por R. arizonensis, a\n        través de la determinación (r<sup>2</sup>), en P. cembroides fue significativo (p\n        &lt; 0.001) con una correlación positiva marginal con las variables altura, diámetro\n        de tallo y cobertura, presentando valores de 0.12, 0.16 y 0.18, respectivamente. En\n        P. nelsonii la influencia de las variables estructurales sobre el daño no fue\n        significativa, sin embargo, esta especie presentó ligera influencia en el diámetro\n        de tallo y la cobertura. En el efecto combinado de las tres variables estructurales\n        sobre el porcentaje de daño por R. arizonensis en P. cembroides mediante la\n        regresión múltiple (r<sup>2</sup>) se obtuvo un valor de 0.19, siendo altamente\n        significativa (p &lt; 0.001), lo cual indica que ca 20% de la varianza en el daño de\n        R. arizonensis es dependiente de las características estructurales de estos bosques.\n        Por su parte, en P. nelsonii la influencia de las variables estructurales sobre el\n        porcentaje de daño de R. arizonensis no fue significativa (p = 0.128) con valor de\n          r<sup>2</sup> correlación múltiple de 0.12. Los resultados obtenidos en el\n        presente estudio difieren de lo obtenido por quien encontró que al aumentar el\n        diámetro de P. cembroides disminuía el ataque por Retinia y que el mayor daño\n        observado fue en árboles con diámetros &#x2264; 4.0 cm. En la presente\n        investigación, los valores máximos de daño encontrados en P. cembroides ocurrieron\n        en individuos con tallos de 20 cm y con 3-3.5 m de altura; el individuo con menor\n        daño medía 2.5 cm de diámetro y 1.80 m de altura. En P. nelsonii el individuo que\n        presentó mayor daño por R. arizonensis (20% del follaje), exhibió un diámetro de\n        tallo de 14 cm y 4 m de altura, en tanto que el árbol con menor daño presentó\n        diámetro de tallo de ~8 a 12 cm con altura y de ~3 a 4 m. Lo anterior puede deberse\n        a que el estudio se realizó en una plantación con factores controlados como la edad,\n        distancia entre plantas y riego. El presente estudio se realizó bajo condiciones\n        naturales, donde se involucran otras variables diferenciales, tales como la edad de\n        planta, competencia intra e interespecífica y el microclima, entre otros. El mayor\n        daño encontrado en P. cembroides (ca 2 veces mayor) puede deberse -entre otras\n        causas- a que esta especie presenta mayor densidad, lo cual incrementa la\n        posibilidad de la interacción planta-insecto, lo que queda de manifiesto con lo\n        expuesto por Feeny. Así mismo, la expresión de mayor cobertura (mayor fronda) de\n        esta especie respecto a P. nelsonii, ha sido documentada anteriormente para\n        bosques.</p>\n      <p>Regeneración. El éxito de cualquier especie está basado en la regeneración natural,\n        la que se mide por la capacidad reproductiva (producción media de semillas), que\n        depende de la correcta polinización, amarre de frutos y la dispersión de semillas.\n        Posteriormente, la predación pre- y postdispersión, viablidad de la semilla,\n        germinación, crecimiento de las plántulas y el crecimiento vegetativo hasta alcanzar\n        la etapa juvenil. Todas estas fases requieren de una serie de factores ambientales,\n        clima y suelo que garanticen el éxito reproductivo. Respecto a este tema, que la\n        regeneración natural constituye uno de los problemas torales para la sucesión de las\n        especies piñoneras. En el presente estudio se encontraron 28 plántulas de Pinus\n        cembroides y 20 de P. nelsonii en los sitios de estudio. La proporción de\n        plántulas/adultos fue de 20.6 y 42.6%, respectivamente, para estas especies.\n        Estudios anteriores sobre esta variable en la misma zona de estudio fueron\n        realizados por donde la regeneración porcentual con respecto a los adultos fue de\n        49.6% para P. cembroides y 63.4% para P. nelsonii. La óptima regeneración observada\n        para ambas especies, puede deberse entre otros factores al buen contenido de materia\n        orgánica (10.3% en el sitio con P. cembroides y 8.6% en el sitio con P. nelsonii),\n        con lo que se clasifican como suelos ricos lo que mejora la captación de humedad que\n        es uno de los requisitos básicos para la germinación.</p>\n      <p>Pinus nelsonii presenta una estructura vertical y horizontal poco compacta, con\n        ramificación más abierta y una densidad de plantas adultas menor. Por otra parte P.\n        cembroides, al mostrarse con una estructura densa y copiosa, aumenta la competencia\n        por luz y nutrientes que también son elementales en la germinación. Además, algunos\n        autores mencionan que el incremento de la temperatura por el cambio climático mejora\n        la regeneración natural, sobre todo en las regiones frías. Sin embargo, estos\n        resultados son supuestos ya que estas plántulas pueden ser afectadas por las\n        sequías, la competencia por agua y nutrientes, así como daños por el pastoreo como\n        lo señalan en Pinus pinea (L).</p>\n      <p>Es indudable la necesidad de complementar los resultados sobre el daño de Retinia\n        arizonensis, así como los factores que favorecen el ataque de pinos piñoneros en la\n        región de Miquihuana, debido a que el porcentaje de plantas (ca 99% en P. cembroides\n        y ca 98% en P. nelsonii) con daños de diversa magnitud, supera a lo reportado por\n        otros investigadores. Así mismo, aun cuando los daños no provocan la muerte\n        inmediata de las plantas, retardan el crecimiento vegetativo y en consecuencia,\n        afectan la producción de conillos y conos, reduciendo por ende la producción de\n        semillas, lo que en el futuro afectará la regeneración natural de estos pinos\n        piñoneros.</p>\n    </sec>\n  </body>\n  <back>\n    <fn-group>\n      <fn fn-type=\"supported-by\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <p><bold>Soporte:</bold> Esta investigación fue apoyada por la Universitat de\n          Teherán de Ciencias Médicas y Servicios de Salud.</p>\n      </fn>\n    </fn-group>\n    <ack>\n      <title>AGRADECIMIENTOS</title>\n      <p>Al Conacyt, por la Beca otorgada al primer autor (IFL) para realizar estudios de\n        Doctorado.

Enfoque actual en el tratamiento» publicada en la REVISTA\n      CHILENA DE PEDIATRíA. Sin embargo, los últimos 2 años, han sido testigo de una serie de\n      estudios que han desafiado el conocimiento convencional, y que han dado lugar a un\n      enfoque menos agresivo para el paciente con <italic>shock s</italic>éptico, lo que ha\n      llevado al paradigma de que «menos puede ser más».</p>\n    <p>Sobre el protocolo de reanimación precoz guiada metas o <italic>Early goal directed\n        therapy</italic> (EGDT): Este protocolo de reanimación inicial del\n        <italic>shock</italic> séptico, que incorpora, entre otras, la inserción de un\n      catéter venoso central, medición de la saturación venosa central de oxígeno, uso de\n      inotropos y transfusión de glóbulos rojos, fue adoptado en 2004 por la campaña\n      «Sobreviviendo a la Sepsis», y aparece en las guías de tratamiento del\n        <italic>shock</italic> séptico pediátrico. Recientemente, 3 ensayos multicéntricos y\n      aleatorizados que incluyeron más de 4.000 pacientes, reexaminaron el efecto de la EGDT\n      en la morbimortalidad de la sepsis en adultos, el estudio ProCESS en EE. UU., ARISE en\n      Australia-Nueva Zelandia y el estudio ProMISe en Inglaterra demostraron la EGDT, no\n      redujo la mortalidad en pacientes con <italic>shock</italic> séptico comparado al\n      cuidado usual<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>\n    <p>Sobre los bolos de fluidos en la reanimación inicial: La literatura clínica que avala las\n      recomendaciones del ACCM-PALS, respecto a los bolos de fluidos en la reanimación a\n      administrar durante la primera hora en el <italic>shock</italic> séptico pediátrico -de\n      20 hasta 200 ml/kg- está basada en estudios retrospectivos, con un número pequeño de\n      pacientes. Desde el año 1991 existen escasos ensayos de buena calidad en la literatura\n      pediátrica, que evalúen el rol de los bolos de fluidos en reanimación de la sepsis.</p>\n    <p>El estudio <italic>Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy</italic> (FEAST) realizado en\n      África, que comparó la administración de 20 ml/kg como fluidos de reanimación\n        <italic>vs.</italic> el uso de fluidos de mantención en niños con infecciones\n      graves, reportó un 30% de mayor mortalidad en los pacientes que recibieron fluidos de\n      reanimación. A pesar de sus limitaciones -población estudiada en gran porcentaje con\n      malaria y recursos hospitalarios deficientes- este estudio ha puesto una alerta en la\n      estrategia de bolos de fluidos en la reanimación del <italic>shock</italic> séptico,\n      recomendada hoy en día.</p>\n    <p>Cinco estudios en niños críticos han demostrado que la sobrecarga de fluidos en la unidad\n      de cuidados intensivos se asocia a una prolongación de la ventilación mecánica y\n      estadía, y en algunos casos un aumento en la mortalidad.</p>\n    <p>Dos ensayos pediátricos prospectivos, en curso, el primero en Canadá\n        <italic>(Squezze)</italic> que compara fluidos con inotropos y el segundo en\n      Inglaterra <italic>(FiSh)</italic> donde se evalúan diferentes dosis de fluidos en los\n      bolos de reanimación en niños con sepsis grave, probablemente permitirán, un\n      acercamiento más racional en la estrategia de reanimación inicial de la\n        sepsis<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref\n        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>\n    <p>Sobre las transfusiones con glóbulos rojos: aunque se cree que el umbral de hemoglobina\n      (Hb) para transfundir glóbulos rojos (GR) en niños con sepsis debería ser alto, los\n      datos extraídos de la literatura no avalarían este supuesto. Holst en un estudio\n      multicéntrico, comparó 1.005 adultos con <italic>shock</italic> séptico para recibir una\n      transfusión de GR según niveles de Hb inferiores a 7 o 9 g/dl. En este estudio, la\n      mortalidad a 90 días fue similar en ambos grupos de pacientes. El uso de la estrategia\n      conservadora, redujo el uso de productos sanguíneos en un 50%<sup>(</sup><xref\n        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>\n    <p>Así como nuevas intervenciones se han asociado a mejores desenlaces en pacientes\n      críticos, a modo de ejemplo, desescalada en antibióticos, disminución del volumen\n      corriente, menor sedación, también el empleo de menos fluidos de reanimación, menos\n      transfusiones y menos monitorización hemodinámica invasiva, confirman que en el caso de\n      la sepsis «menos puede ser más»<italic>.</italic></p>\n  </body>\n  <back>\n    <ref-list>\n      <title>Bibliografía</title>\n      <ref id=\"B1\">\n        <label>1</label>\n        <mixed-citation>Arriagada S.D., Donoso F.A. &amp; Cruces R.P..

Sobre\n        las recomendaciones para el paquete de reanimación inicial de la «Campaña\n        sobreviviendo a la sepsis», específicamente el uso de la terapia con fluidos, luego\n        de la resucitación inicial temprana dirigida por metas, el concepto que «menos es\n        más» existe ya desde hace tiempo en la comunidad científica<sup>(</sup><xref\n          ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sin embargo, ha presentado un\n        nuevo interés con la divulgación de recientes comunicaciones como fue señalado en el\n          <italic>addendum</italic> de nuestra publicación<sup>(</sup><xref\n          ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>\n      <p>La sana conducta de valorar el adecuado uso de protocolos y no transformarlos en un\n        «libro de cocina médica» es absolutamente recomendable en la medicina intensiva.\n        Como también lo es para el paciente séptico el evaluarlo críticamente e identificar\n        los pilares terapéuticos, basado en la fisiopatología subyacente, particularmente en\n        el ámbito extra UCI.</p>\n      <p>Se ha discutido, recientemente, para el paciente séptico sobre el adecuado nivel de\n        hemoglobina, la reanimación con fluidos y la respuesta a su uso mediante\n        monitorización hemodinámica funcional, y el beneficio de evitar y tratar la\n        sobrecarga hídrica dado sus consecuencias deletéreas<sup>(</sup><xref\n          ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">1</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\"\n          >3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>\n      <p>Comunicaciones han agregado a la resucitación inicial temprana dirigida por metas en\n        el listado de opciones terapéuticas de corta vida en nuestra\n          especialidad<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">4</xref><sup>)</sup>,\n        mientras que otras aún recomiendan una mirada de precaución<sup>(</sup><xref\n          ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. A modo de ejemplo, esto mismo\n        parece estar ocurriendo en la actualidad en pediatría para el concepto del daño\n        inducido por ventilación mecánica, y el uso de ventilación de alta frecuencia\n        oscilatoria.</p>\n      <p>En el futuro, en vez de basarse en fenotipos generales (taquicardia y fiebre), la\n        identificación dentro de la población de los pacientes a tratar, será esencial para\n        establecer una terapia no exclusivamente cuantitativa, sino más bien\n        individualizada, logrando así una adecuada dosis del uso de fluidos para\n        reanimación, antibióticos y ventilación mecánica entre otros.</p>\n      <p>La rápida divulgación de la información de los estudios pediátricos en curso (Squezze\n        y FiSh), posiblemente agregarán mayor evidencia específica para esta población, la\n        cual no pudo ser discutida en nuestra comunicación pues aún no se conocen sus\n        resultados.</p>\n    </body>\n    <back>\n      <ref-list>\n        <title>Referencias</title>\n        <ref id=\"B6\">\n          <label>1</label>\n          <mixed-citation>Durairaj L., Schmidt G.A.

Así, se desarrollaron procesos de transformación política que se\n      conjugaron con un creciente movimiento social, principalmente compuesto por trabajadores\n      urbanos organizados en sindicatos y enlazados con ciertos políticos que construyeron un\n      lenguaje de integración ciudadana que es ya conocido en la historiografía\n      latinoamericana como “populismo clásico”. En ese momento, como bien lo apuntaron Leslie\n      Bethel e Ian Roxborough (1992) en sus ensayos introductorios y de cierre de Latin\n      America Between the Second World War and the Cold War, 1944-1948 (Cambridge: Cambridge\n      University Press), se dieron alianzas inéditas entre partidos, motivadas por los\n      procesos internos y alentadas por la lucha contra el nazismo y el fascismo. Siguiendo a\n      Bethel y a Roxborough, tal contexto produjo una serie de leyes sociales y progresistas\n      que permitieron la afirmación de cambios importantes que pretendían dar al traste con\n      algunos de los procesos históricos que desarrolló el siglo XIX. Fue ese uno de los\n      experimentos democráticos más intensos e interesantes que se desarrollaron en la América\n      Latina del siglo XX y que, sin embargo, desembocó, a partir de 1945-1948, en una\n      reacción que limitó la apertura democrática y en algunos países la echó hacia atrás,\n      creando dictaduras e incluso echando abajo o limitando la legislación laboral emitida en\n      la década.</p>\n    <p>En aquel proceso de movilización y choque, una lucha se había arrastrado desde la década\n      de 1930 y se fortaleció durante el primer lustro de la de 1940. Se trataba de la\n      organización de ligas simpatizantes de la república española. Muchos actores\n      fundamentales de la política de América Latina de aquella década y un torrente de\n      intelectuales participaron de esas ligas y clamaron por lo que se conoció como “el\n      problema español”. Pero quizás en ninguna parte del continente tal activismo llevó a una\n      conjunción tan fuerte con el exilio español, con la política local, con las\n      transformaciones culturales y con los cambios geopolíticos e industriales como en el\n      México de la década de 1940.</p>\n    <p>El libro 1945, entre la euforia y la esperanza: el México posrevolucionario y el exilio\n      republicano español, editado por Mari Carmen Serra Puche, José Francisco Mejía Flores y\n      Carlos Sola Ayape, constituye un valiosísimo acercamiento a varias de las luchas que\n      abrió el exilio español en el México de la primera mitad de la década de 1940. Es un\n      libro compuesto por 11 ensayos que constituyen un esfuerzo de análisis producido en la\n      Cátedra del Exilio, una cátedra formada en 2006 por la UNED, la Universidad de Alcalá,\n      la UNAM, la Universidad Carlos III y la Fundación Pablo Iglesias. En el libro participan\n      investigadores consolidados y también investigadores recién doctorados, lo cual conjuga\n      muy bien experiencias de investigación, temas innovadores y perspectivas diferentes.</p>\n    <p>En ese sentido, la contribución de este libro es múltiple: sirve, por un lado, para\n      visualizar varias de las facetas y las luchas del exilio español republicano en México,\n      permite apreciar niveles diferentes de análisis que van desde la experiencia individual\n      hasta visiones macro sobre las relaciones internacionales y la geopolítica; por otro\n      lado, conecta los procesos vividos por el mundo entre 1939 y 1945, con la vida en un\n      México que veía consolidada la institucionalización de muchos de los procesos que venía\n      atravesando desde la década de 1910. De modo que es un libro que mira a los españoles en\n      México, pero que también estudia a México y su cultura política y pública en su relación\n      específica con el exilio. </p>\n    <p>Partiendo de lo anterior, quisiera referirme a tres cosas fundamentales que aportan los\n      trabajos de este libro. En primer lugar, este es un libro conmemorativo; por un lado,\n      busca recordar el exilio de 1939; por otro lado, busca encadenarse con 1945. Pero es a\n      este segundo al que le dedica no solo el título, sino el poder de convertirse en lo que\n      los editores llaman un “año bisagra”; es decir, un momento que veía finalizar un tipo de\n      política internacional y una conflictividad asociada con el fascismo (como fue la\n      Segunda Guerra Mundial) y también veía comenzar una nueva etapa basada en el\n      enfrentamiento y a veces la distención entre los dos grandes bloques que se consolidaron\n      después de la guerra mundial y que provocaron la Guerra Fría.</p>\n    <p>Pero 1945 no es solo un año significativo por esa función ajustada a la geopolítica\n      mundial. En cambio, los ensayos en este libro muestran el tremendo valor para el exilio\n      español en México que tuvo aquella fecha. Fue, si se quiere, el año de la esperanza\n      política para ese exilio, por efecto de la reunión de las Cortes y por la reconstitución\n      de la institucionalidad republicana también en suelo mexicano. Como dice Pablo Jesús\n      Carrión Sánchez en su ensayo, la convocatoria de las Cortes representaba la posibilidad\n      de vincular el pasado y el futuro y relegar a Franco a “la categoría de doloroso\n      paréntesis” (p. 86). Ese mismo año, en agosto, México vio izar la bandera de la\n      República española en el exilio y el nombramiento de Diego Martínez Barrio como\n      presidente interino. Y fue el año también en que Luis Quintanilla, representante de\n      México en la Conferencia de San Francisco, lanzó un brillante discurso de apoyo a la\n      España republicana en el que conectó a Franco con los perdedores de la Segunda Guerra\n      Mundial y alentó a las naciones del mundo a no dejar que los republicanos españoles\n      perdieran su lucha, habiendo sido ellos los primeros en luchar contra las fuerzas del\n      fascismo. Como lo analiza muy bien en su trabajo Luis Hernando Noguera, esa conferencia\n      en San Francisco constituyó el “gran triunfo” de la Junta de Liberación Española que\n      desaparecería unas semanas después para ser sustituida por el gobierno republicano en el\n      exilio.</p>\n    <p>Así, 1945 fue realmente un año fundador para la esperanza de los españoles republicanos\n      en México. En tal sentido, este libro, que pretende conmemorar 75 años del exilio\n      español, también abre la puerta para conmemorar, aquella esperanza republicana de 1945.\n      De esa manera, 1939 y 1945, se engarzan con 2014 y 2015 gracias a esa vía que abre este\n      trabajo.</p>\n    <p>En segundo lugar, quisiera subrayar ese juego de niveles analíticos que ofrece el libro.\n      Se presentan en este texto tanto vidas y experiencias individuales como la de don Diego\n      Martínez Barrio, como intentos institucionales como las Cortes, el mismo gobierno\n      republicano en el exilio y sus azares económicos y también el juego de la geopolítica\n      mundial. Esta posibilidad que tiene el lector de mirar desde distintas ventanas la\n      problemática del exilio y sus instituciones es un gran logro de este texto.</p>\n    <p>Es destacable la posibilidad de ir de la mano de Leandro Álvarez Rey para escudriñar la\n      vida y el difícil exilio de don Diego en México. Es muy atrayente cómo la biografía de\n      don Diego representa, por mucho, la de la república en el exilio y cómo las esperanzas\n      de aquel y también sus sudores y sufrimientos se ataron a la mismísima institucionalidad\n      de la que fue presidente. La celebración de su memoria tanto en Sevilla como en México,\n      estuvo atada sin ninguna duda con esa representación de una vida con una esperanza.</p>\n    <p>Tal esperanza dependió, empero, no solo de las divisiones del exilio y el enfrentamiento\n      de sus grupos, sino, como lo prueba muy bien Aurelio Velázquez Hernández, de las\n      finanzas del gobierno en el exilio. Es fundamental subrayar la conclusión de este autor\n      de que “el agotamiento económico” constituye también una parte de la explicación del\n      declive del gobierno en el exilio (p. 159).</p>\n    <p>Los ensayos de política exterior escritos por Agustín Sánchez Andrés, Fabián Herrera\n      León, José Francisco Mejía Flores y por Lorenzo Delgado GómezEscalonilla, dan constancia\n      del juego del poder del reconocimiento internacional y la lucha del exilio en ese\n      parteaguas de 1945. Estos textos dejan en evidencia lo cambiante de las asociaciones\n      internacionales una vez que los Estados Unidos ingresaron en la Segunda Guerra Mundial y\n      una vez que dicho conflicto finalizó. Así, si la participación de los estadounidenses en\n      la guerra volvió posible la denuncia internacional sobre el régimen franquista y, en esa\n      vía, la posibilidad de la administración Ávila Camacho de acuerpar con más claridad la\n      lucha del exilio como lo había hecho Cárdenas, el inicio de la Guerra Fría y la\n      consolidación de Franco como un posible aliado anticomunista, echaron abajo las\n      posibilidades de que los republicanos españoles recibiesen el reconocimiento de más\n      repúblicas occidentales y menos el de los Estados Unidos.</p>\n    <p>En tercer lugar, se debe destacar el aporte de este libro en la inspección de una\n      historia social y cultural del exilio, del antifranquismo y del antirrepublicanismo en\n      México. Es importante subrayar el aporte de Patricio Herrera González en su inspección\n      de las acciones del gran líder de los trabajadores latinoamericanos, Vicente Lombardo\n      Toledano, en la organización de un frente obrero internacional que denunció al\n      franquismo y acuerpó la república española en cuanta actividad participó entre 1939 y\n      1945. Como paréntesis, después de leer ese ensayo, me ha parecido fundamental tratar de\n      revisar las fuentes mexicanas para mirar más de cerca la relación entre Lombardo\n      Toledano y la organización del movimiento obrero sindical en Costa Rica entre 1943 y\n      1948. Es conocido el viaje de Lombardo Toledano a Costa Rica en octubre de 1943 para\n      asistir a la fundación de la Confederación General de Trabajadores y también su amistad\n      con el líder comunista costarricense Manuel Mora, pero ciertamente no se conoce la forma\n      en que Lombardo Toledano se refirió a Costa Rica desde México o, si lo hizo, cómo vio\n      los acontecimientos que se desencadenaron en este país entre 1946 y 1948.</p>\n    <p>Finalmente Carlos Sola Ayape, Austreberto Martínez Villegas y Mauricio César Ramírez\n      Sánchez nos develan varias dimensiones de las acciones de los grupos mexicanos que\n      enfrentaron el exilio español y se le opusieron y la forma en cómo la iconografía y las\n      caricaturas retrataron la Guerra Civil española y el exilio. Estas dimensiones del\n      análisis dejan ver la multiplicidad de frentes abiertos por el exilio español dentro de\n      México y, en ese sentido, lo complicado y heterogéneo de aquel proceso.</p>\n    <p>Por lo dicho, este es un libro muy importante para acercarse en términos históricos y\n      públicos a lo que 1939 y 1945 representan para España y para México. Es un gran esfuerzo\n      el que se ha hecho por develar esa multiplicidad de experiencias y las varias formas del\n      exilio republicano español. Creo que este texto, además, puede impulsar la imaginación y\n      la inspiración de los colegas historiadores en América Latina en tanto que el exilio\n      español, como la guerra civil española, fueron también un tema destacado de la década de\n      1940 en todos nuestros países. Además, como lo deja en claro este libro, las\n      vinculaciones entre lo local, lo regional, lo mundial, lo político, lo geopolítico, lo\n      social y lo cultural aparejadas a aquella década, es fundamental seguir examinándolas y\n      profundizándolas.</p>\n  </body>\n</article>\n",

Distintivamente, este\n      género tiene en el conectivo de las anteras un apéndice dorso-basal, bulbiforme e\n      inflado, redondeado a apiculado. <italic>Meriania</italic> Sw., un género muy afín,\n      posee anteras con un espolón dorso-basal nunca inflado, a veces un apéndice dorsal\n      ascendente. Las especies de <italic>Axinaea</italic> son arbustos y árboles que\n      prefieren bosques montanos y habitan desde 11°N en Costa Rica hasta 18°S en Bolivia,\n      entre 1100 y 3800 m de elevación, pero predominan en los Andes desde Venezuela hasta\n      Bolivia.</p>\n    <p>Después de una breve introducción, esta revisión incluye notas sobre historia taxonómica,\n      seguidas por una sección de morfología, que examina todos los órganos de estas plantas,\n      con ilustraciones de gran calidad. Las inflorescencias y todas las piezas florales están\n      especialmente bien descritas e ilustradas. El texto continúa con secciones cortas sobre\n      anatomía, número de cromosomas, concepto de especie, relaciones filogenéticas,\n      distribución geográfica, ecología reproductiva, estatus de conservación y etnobotánica,\n      para dar lugar a un tratamiento sistemático, que incluye una descripción formal del\n      género, una clave dicotómica con sangrías y la descripción detallada de todas las\n      especies, cada una con un mapa de distribución, una lista de especímenes examinados y\n      dibujos detallados. Además, se incluyen fotografías a colores de plantas vivas de 13\n      especies. Los autores estudiaron unos 700 especímenes de 18 herbarios.</p>\n    <p>\n      <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">Kriebel &amp; Umaña (2007)</xref> anotaron 20 a 25\n      especies de <italic>Axinaea</italic> en total. En contraste, Cotton <italic>et\n        al.</italic> reconocen 41 especies. De éstas, una sola, <italic>A.\n        costaricensis</italic> Cogn., alcanza el sur del istmo centroamericano y habita en\n      Costa Rica, Panamá y Venezuela. Entre los datos de los especímenes examinados (pág. 42)\n      aparece <italic>Bocas del Toro</italic> como provincia de Costa Rica, cuando lo correcto\n      es Panamá. Los autores indican que es la distribución más disyunta de una especie de\n        <italic>Axinaea</italic>, pero no hallaron diferencias notables entre las\n      poblaciones del istmo y de Venezuela; por eso especulan que las poblaciones\n      centroamericanas pueden ser el resultado de un <italic>evento reciente de dispersión a\n        larga distancia</italic>. Yo prefiero pensar que la falta de registros de esta\n      especie en Colombia, un país con extensas montañas, se debe simplemente a que todavía no\n      ha sido recolectada allí. </p>\n    <p>En la clave hay dos errores al numerar las especies: se usó el No. 12 dos veces y no se\n      usó el No. 30, pero éste se asignó erróneamente a <italic>A. wurdackii</italic> Sagást.\n        <italic>et al.</italic>, que es la especie No. 41. Así, en la clave las especies\n      están numeradas de 1 a 39. El párrafo anterior a la clave también menciona erróneamente\n      39 especies. Los autores aceptan 33 de los 38 nombres publicados antes de este estudio y\n      describen ocho especies nuevas, todas con la autoría de “E. Cotton”: <italic>A.\n        alata</italic>, <italic>A. campii</italic>, <italic>A. confusa</italic>, <italic>A.\n        dentata</italic>, <italic>A. disrupta</italic>, <italic>A. luteynii</italic>,\n        <italic>A. minutiflora</italic> y <italic>A. pendula</italic>. Un dato relevante es\n      que 28 especies son endémicas en algún país y su hábitat está seriamente amenazado por\n      actividades humanas. Como es común en un trabajo monográfico completo, al final hallamos\n      una sección de “Nombres dudosos y taxa excluidos” (la mayoría son especies de\n        <italic>Meriania</italic> que originalmente fueron descritas en\n        <italic>Axinaea</italic>) y una lista de especímenes identificados\n        (<italic>exsiccatae</italic>).</p>\n  </body>\n  <back>\n    <ref-list>\n      <title>REFERENCIA</title>\n      <ref id=\"B1\">\n        <mixed-citation>Kriebel, R. &amp; Umaña, G.

Por tal motivo, el propósito de este artículo es analizar las\n          causas y consecuencias de los accidentes laborales ocurridos durante el segundo\n          semestre del año 2012 en dos proyectos de construcción de Neiva. El alcance fue\n          de tipo documental considerando como fuente de información los soportes de los\n          accidentes laborales reportados ante la Administradora de Riesgo Laborales\n          (ARL); para determinar las causas que dieron origen a dichos accidentes se\n          utilizó el modelo de Frank E. Bird. Se analizaron 117 accidentes en los que se\n          identificaron 195 faltas de control, 136 factores personales, 112 factores del\n          trabajo, 151 actos inseguros y 54 condiciones inseguras; lo anterior teniendo en\n          cuenta que en algunos accidentes se presentaron más de una causa. De esta manera\n          se concluye que el mayor porcentaje de accidentes de trabajo, ha sido generado\n          por faltas de control seguidos por actos inseguros. Por tal motivo se recomienda\n          la realización de programas de gestión de riesgos prioritarios, basados en una\n          adecuada identificación de peligros, que permitan mitigar y controlar los\n          riesgos, desarrollando a la vez en los trabajadores una cultura de autocuidado.\n        </p>\n      </abstract>\n      <kwd-group xml:lang=\"es\">\n        <title>Palabras clave:</title>\n        <kwd>Accidente laboral</kwd>\n        <kwd>causas básicas</kwd>\n        <kwd>causas inmediatas</kwd>\n        <kwd>faltas de control</kwd>\n        <kwd>factores personales</kwd>\n      </kwd-group>\n    </article-meta>\n  </front>\n  <body>\n    <sec sec-type=\"intro\">\n      <title>1. Introducción</title>\n      <p> El sector de la construcción cuenta con un conjunto de riesgos laborales propios de\n        la actividad, los cuales son pertinentes al trabajo realizado en altura, labores de\n        excavación, el izado de materiales y el carácter temporal de sus centros de trabajo,\n        entre otros; lo anterior conlleva a que la ejecución del sistema de gestión de la\n        seguridad y salud en el trabajador de dicho sector, sea aplicado de manera diferente\n          (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">Armengou y Cuéllar, 2002</xref>). Por ello, es\n        claro resaltar que las actividades realizadas en las obras de construcción son\n        consideradas de alto riesgo y que por tanto pueden desencadenar accidentes de\n        trabajo.</p>\n      <p>Los accidentes laborales pueden generarse por causas inmediatas o básicas: las\n        inmediatas son las que producen el accidente de manera directa y están conformadas\n        por actos inseguros (comportamientos inadecuados de los trabajadores que pueden\n        originar un incidente laboral) y condiciones inseguras (Instalaciones, equipos,\n        maquinaria y herramientas que se encuentran en mal estado y ponen en riesgo de\n        sufrir un accidente a los trabajadores). Pero para lograr una solución efectiva de\n        los accidentes de trabajo es fundamental el reconocimiento y control de las causas\n        básicas, las cuales dan origen a las causas inmediatas integradas por factores\n        personales (Hábitos de trabajo incorrectos, Uso incorrecto de equipos, herramientas\n        e instalaciones; defectos físicos o mentales, deficiencias en la audición etc.) y\n        factores del trabajo (Supervisión y liderazgo deficiente; Políticas, procedimientos,\n        guías o practicas inadecuadas; Planeación y/o programación inadecuada del trabajo,\n        etc.) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">Chinchilla, 2002</xref>).</p>\n      <p> Según las estadísticas de la Organización Internacional del Trabajo (OIT), en el\n        informe del Día mundial sobre la seguridad y la salud en el trabajo, “Alrededor del\n        4% del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) mundial se pierde con el costo de las bajas, las\n        muertes y las enfermedades en forma de ausencias al trabajo, tratamientos y\n        prestaciones por incapacidad y por fallecimiento”.</p>\n      <p>La teoría de la pirámide de la accidentalidad desarrollada por Bird en 1969, reveló\n        que por cada accidente grave hay 10 accidentes leves, 30 accidentes con daño a la\n        propiedad y 600 accidentes sin daños ni pérdidas visibles (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n          rid=\"B5\">Chinchilla, 2002</xref>). A este respecto refiere que al comparar la\n        cantidad de incidentes que no ocasionaron lesiones a las personas, con aquellos que\n        si lo ocasionaron; se considera que la implementación de un sistema de análisis de\n        los incidentes puede ser un medio fundamental para prevenir o controlar los\n        accidentes laborales.</p>\n      <p> Por otro lado, mencionan que en la salud y seguridad industrial actualmente es común\n        la práctica de las normas correspondientes; no obstante, dichas normas resultan en\n        numerables ocasiones mal aplicadas, generando dificultades en el desarrollo del\n        proyecto asociados a riesgos que si no son evaluados termina afectando el normal\n        desarrollo de la construcción. Los autores refieren los atrasos en la obra, las\n        pérdidas económicas y los sobrecostos como los principales problemas derivados por\n        la ausencia de planeación del riesgo en seguridad industrial y salud ocupacional.\n        Esta investigación señala que las condiciones de seguridad de obras en el contexto\n        colombiano son deficientes y por lo tanto, generan accidentes que provocan lesiones\n        de todo tipo, incapacidad y muertes. En este sentido, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\"\n          >Buendía (2013)</xref> refiere la importancia de identificar las causas de los\n        accidentes en el área de la construcción, haciendo énfasis en que se debe buscar el\n        verdadero origen de todas las causas que desencadenan el incidente. Por su parte,\n        sostiene que la evaluación de riesgos es un proceso que orienta la toma de\n        decisiones sobre el tipo de acciones preventivas que se deben tomar para minimizar\n        los riesgos laborales.</p>\n      <p>Destaca que la industria de la construcción es una de las actividades laborales con\n        mayor riesgo, demostrado a partir de la elevada incidencia de los accidentes\n        presentados, que ocasionan pérdidas humanas y materiales. Las estadísticas son\n        fundamentales para identificar las causas de los accidentes y para orientar los\n        posibles planes de intervención, así como su efectividad.</p>\n      <p>Ellos afirman que para el año 2011, en Colombia el sector de la construcción obtuvo\n        la tasa de accidentalidad más alta, del 22.71%, de los cuales el 11% de accidentes\n        fueron severos o mortales. Durante el año 2012 en Colombia, de los 532 muertos\n        registrados por accidentes de trabajo, 136 corresponden al sector inmobiliario, 125\n        al de la construcción, mientras que en los campos de transporte, almacenamiento y\n        comunicaciones se presentó un total de 78 víctimas mortales. Lo que indica que en el\n        país 44 personas murieron cada mes por accidentes de trabajo. Estas cifras forman\n        parte de los reportes que las 10 Administradoras de Riesgos Laborales.</p>\n      <p>La federación de Aseguradores Colombianos refieren en una de sus publicaciones, que\n        en el año 2013 cada once horas y media un trabajador murió debido a un accidente\n        laboral y que el promedio de accidentalidad laboral en Colombia correspondió de 62\n        cada hora, lo que equivale a 1.487 casos diarios, debido a lo anterior se concluye\n        que el año pasado se presentaron 543.079 accidentes de trabajo en el país.</p>\n      <p>Lo anterior demuestra la necesidad de estudiar la accidentalidad en el sector de la\n        construcción, y con base en este estudio generar un análisis detallado de las causas\n        que originan los accidentes de trabajo, permitiendo que las empresas adopten este\n        proyecto como base para implementar medidas de prevención y control de la\n        accidentalidad, puesto que, ellos afirman, una obra bien organizada es, en general,\n        una obra segura, planificada, dirigida y controlada.</p>\n      <p>A partir de los resultados que arroja esta investigación, es importante valorar los\n        sistemas de protección respecto a la salud ocupacional y los servicios psicológicos.\n        Por eso este artículo es considerado importante al brindar un mayor conocimiento y\n        dar a conocer la necesidad que tienen las empresas del sector de la construcción, en\n        la implementación y seguimiento de un sistema de seguridad y salud en el trabajo\n        eficaz, en el cual se incluya capacitaciones, estimulación y simulacros que permitan\n        representar posibles riesgos laborales para luego ser prevenidos; además de\n        incorporar en el proceso de selección de personal un protocolo de evaluación\n        referente al funcionamiento ejecutivo, de tal manera que permita contar con un\n        personal idóneo que lleve a disminuir la accidentalidad en las obras, mejorando las\n        condiciones de trabajo, el bienestar de los colaboradores, y contribuyendo así en la\n        mejora de la productividad de las empresas constructoras.</p>\n    </sec>\n    <sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\">\n      <title>2.

También podemos identificar que en varios\n        accidentes se identifican varias causas inmediatas-condiciones inseguras.</p>\n      <p>De las causas inmediatas encontramos que los accidentes son en su mayoría ocasionados\n        por los actos inseguros el 74%, ocurrieron por fallas humanas, las personas\n        desobedecen las prácticas y los procedimientos seguros sin tener en cuenta que\n        cuando incurren en sus actividades laborales pueden sufrir un accidente (<xref\n          ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f3\">Figura 3</xref>).</p>\n      <p>\n        <fig id=\"f3\">\n          <label>Figura 3</label>\n          <caption>\n            <title>Causas inmediatas que inciden en los accidentes presentados.

Discusión y conclusiones</title>\n      <p> De acuerdo a los resultados obtenidos en la presente investigación, se encontró que\n        de los 117 accidentes laborales analizados, las manos y los ojos han sido las partes\n        más afectadas, con un total de 23 y 21 lesiones respectivamente. Con respecto a las\n        manos se considera que esto se debe a que son las partes del cuerpo primordiales\n        para la ejecución de toda actividad, específicamente de manufactura y uno de los\n        principales sectores donde se presentan accidentes laborales reportados a las ARL es\n        la construcción con 10.46%; por otro lado, los ojos son la segunda parte del cuerpo\n        más afectadas debido a la presencia de cuerpos extraños que se presentan en la\n        realización de las actividades en dicho sector. En cuanto a las causas se\n        identificaron 195 faltas de control, siendo las más relevantes la falta de Análisis\n        y procedimientos de trabajo, observaciones planeadas del trabajo y entrenamiento de\n        los trabajadores; 248 causas básicas, de las cuales 136 corresponden a factores\n        personales y 112 a factores del trabajo; 205 causas inmediatas, de las cuales 151\n        fueron por actos inseguros y 54 por condiciones inseguras.</p>\n      <p> De esta manera se concluye que la ocurrencia de los accidentes de trabajo han sido\n        generados en mayor parte por faltas de control, seguido de actos inseguros; que como\n        lo define <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">Chinchilla (2002)</xref>, se deben a todo\n        tipo de acciones u omisiones cometidas por las personas que posibilitan que se\n        produzcan los accidentes; teniendo en cuenta lo anterior, la edad de los\n        trabajadores es un aspecto relevante ya que la presente investigación y otros\n        autores (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">Agencia Europea para la Seguridad y Salud en\n          el Trabajo, 2007</xref>) coinciden en que los trabajadores jóvenes (de 18 a 35\n        años) son los que sufren más accidentes laborales, debido a la falta de experiencia,\n        la falta de concientización de los peligros y riesgos presentes en los puestos de\n        trabajo. El tercer lugar de las principales causas de los accidentes laborales\n        analizados se debe a factores personales que tienen que ver con la capacidad del\n        trabajador (capacitación, destreza, aptitud, entre otros). Los principales\n        mecanismos causantes de los accidentes de trabajo son caídas de objetos (29%)\n        seguido de pisadas, choques o golpes (24%); resultados similares fueron encontrados\n        por otros autores (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">Cruz et al., 2009</xref>).</p>\n      <p> La falta de control sobre las actividades ocasiona una mayor exposición al riesgo,\n        cuando no se implementan medidas de control o barreras de control el trabajador está\n        totalmente expuesto a los riesgos asociados a la actividad. De acuerdo a los\n        estudios realizados se encontró que uno de los atributos que más se relacionaba con\n        la magnitud del riesgo percibido correspondía al temor, siendo evidente en\n        actividades como no usar los elementos de protección individual, el trabajar en\n        espacios de baja iluminación, el uso de instalaciones eléctricas en mal estado y la\n        exposición a gases y vapores, la magnitud del riesgo es alto junto con el temor. Lo\n        anterior puede presentarse debido a que las actividades estudiadas por Slovic et\n        al., correspondían a aquellas situaciones cotidianas a las que se expone la\n        población en general, mientras que las actividades objeto de este estudio,\n        corresponden a aquellas específicas a la población trabajadora en el sector de la\n        construcción, donde se pueden encontrar mayores beneficios para los expuestos.</p>\n      <p> Otro atributo que se menciona en los estudios realizados es el conocimiento por los\n        expuestos, donde en la mayoría de los estudios realizados ha encontrado que se\n        percibe mayor riesgo en aquellas actividades que se perciben como más conocidas. Sin\n        embargo, en este estudio el atributo conocido por los expuestos se encontró en un\n        valor alto de conocimiento, mientras que las actividades de exposición a ruido,\n        exposición a polvo, desorden en la obra y manipulación de objetos y herramientas\n        presentaron una magnitud de riesgo baja. De acuerdo a los resultados obtenidos en\n        este estudio, se evidencia que cuando se percibe que las consecuencias de alguna\n        actividad son inmediatas, los trabajadores manifiestan que la magnitud del riesgo es\n        más alta, mientras que al percibir que las consecuencias son demoradas, la gravedad\n        del daño se percibe como menor. En este sentido los trabajadores estarían aludiendo\n        a un sentimiento de inmediatez de las consecuencias para determinar la gravedad del\n        daño, que a un grado de temor o rechazo por aquellas actividades que se consideren\n        como más dañinas para la salud y el bienestar, al igual que lo encontrado en los\n        estudios tradicionales de percepción del riesgo.</p>\n      <p> Relacionando los resultados de la presente investigación y <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n          rid=\"B8\">Consumer (2003)</xref>, se identifica que los lunes son los días en los\n        se ha sufrido mayor cantidad de accidentes laborales; se afirma que tiene que ver\n        con la pérdida del ritmo que diariamente llevan los trabajadores durante sus\n        funciones, ya que al comenzar la actividad laboral tras un fin de semana de\n        descanso, el organismo humano tarda un tiempo en adaptarse al ejercicio en el\n        trabajo y a los peligros que lleva aparejados. Además de lo anterior, se presume que\n        el consumo de alcohol el fin de semana es muy común en los trabajadores del sector\n          (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">Comisión Ejecutiva Confederal de UGT,\n          2011</xref>) y esta acción conlleva a que el periodo de descanso, sueño y de\n        relajación antes de volver al trabajo se haya interrumpido, por tal motivo se\n        considera que dicha versión puede incidir en la ocurrencia de los accidentes.</p>\n      <p>De este modo para que las empresas de construcción cumplan a cabalidad con las\n        actividades requeridas en materia de seguridad y salud en el trabajo, se considera\n        indispensable la disponibilidad de recursos y la constante planificación por parte\n        de los agentes implicados para este estudio en específico. Por los resultados\n        obtenidos en la investigación, se sugiere a dicho sector efectuar un programa de\n        seguridad cuya finalidad se base en la adecuada identificación, reconocimiento,\n        evaluación y control de los diferentes peligros y riesgos que se originen en los\n        lugares de trabajo encaminado a la protección de las manos y los ojos, partes del\n        cuerpo más afectadas durante la ejecución de las actividades; así como también\n        proporcionar a los trabajadores la formación e información necesaria para el\n        desempeño de las funciones en óptimas condiciones de seguridad, en donde la\n        inducción diaria sobre el desarrollo de las actividades a través de una seguridad\n        basada en el comportamiento sea primordial para todos los trabajadores sin excepción\n        alguna, y además emprender programas de sensibilización y concienciación de tomar la\n        seguridad como un valor fundamental de tal manera que se contribuya en la\n        disminución de actos inseguros, que de manera constante se presentan durante el\n        desarrollo de las actividades laborales en los proyectos de construcción.</p>\n      <p> Asimismo, se recomienda a las empresas, elaborar y estandarizar el análisis y los\n        procedimientos de trabajo, especialmente las tareas críticas, las cuales se deben\n        identificar mediante un adecuado estudio de riesgos, que permita valorarlos para\n        diseñar programas de gestión que faciliten su intervención y control. Además como lo\n        indica la <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">Agencia Europea para la Seguridad y la\n          Salud en el Trabajo (2002)</xref> el compromiso de la dirección es esencial para\n        el establecimiento de políticas claras en materia de salud y seguridad y para el\n        suministro de recursos adecuados para su ejecución”.</p>\n      <p>Se considera que la planeación es una de las partes fundamentales que toda\n        organización debe realizar para la prevención de los accidentes laborales, se trata\n        de reunir en un documento, de forma clara y detallada, toda la información\n        indispensable para realizar una actividad preventiva sistemática, coherente y\n        eficaz, frente a los riesgos del trabajo presentes en la actividad de una empresa\n          (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">Collado, 2008</xref>). El tiempo y el dinero\n        manejados en esta actividad se recuperan obteniendo resultados efectivos y rápidos;\n        es necesario tener claro que no basta con que se plasme en un papel, sino que se\n        lleve también a la práctica y para esto es fundamental que se supervise el\n        desarrollo adecuado del mismo. Los datos reflejados en la presente investigación\n        demuestran la necesidad de emprender el tema de la seguridad y la salud en el\n        trabajo en todas sus dimensiones y con la participación de todos los integrantes de\n        la organización, (empleadores, administradoras de riesgos laborales, contratistas,\n        trabajadores e instituciones de formación) y de esta forma se pueda realizar una\n        propuesta común, que tenga como objetivo mejorar la calidad de vida de los\n        trabajadores del sector, disminuyendo los incidentes de trabajo.</p>\n      <p>Por último, se considera de gran importancia profundizar en una futura investigación\n        el tema relacionado con los comportamientos de las personas y la motivación,\n        teniendo en cuenta que los actos inseguros hacen parte de las principales causas que\n        han generado accidentes laborales en dichos proyectos de construcción y que además\n        estos pueden ir relacionados con la motivación, ya que esta es la fuerza que\n        estimula a una persona a hacer algo provocado bien sea por un estímulo externo que\n        proviene del ambiente, problemas familiares, económicos o generado por procesos\n        mentales del trabajador, etc. Por lo tanto, un estudio psicológico relacionado con\n        dicho tema ayudaría a entender con mayor profundidad las causas básicas relacionadas\n        con los factores personales y las causas inmediatas relacionadas con los actos\n        inseguros de los trabajadores que laboran en este sector, el cual ha sido de gran\n        importancia para la economía del país (Portafolio.co, 2013? pero que a la vez\n        presenta a diario gran cantidad de peligros y riesgos latentes que pueden afectar la\n        integridad física, mental y social, de los colaboradores.</p>\n    </sec>\n  </body>\n  <back>\n    <ref-list>\n      <title>Referencias</title>\n      <ref id=\"B1\">\n        <mixed-citation>Agencia Europea para la seguridad y Salud en el Trabajo (2002),\n          Prevencion de Accidentes Laborales, 2002.

Therefore, the\n          objective of this article is to analyze the causes and consequences of\n          occupational accidents occured in the second semester of 2012 in two\n          construction projects in Neiva, Colombia. The approach is documentary, supported\n          by information sources of occupational accidents reported to the Administration\n          of Occupational Accidents (ARL in Spanish); the model developed by Frank E. Bird\n          was used to determine the causes of these accidents. A total of 117 accidents\n          were analyzed, detecting 195 failures of control, 136 personal factors, 112 work\n          related factors, 151 unsafe acts and 54 unsafe conditions; some accidents had\n          more than one cause. In this manner, the authors conclude that the largest\n          percentage of occupational accidents were caused by lack of control, followed by\n          unsafe acts. Therefore, the use of programs of risk management priorities is\n          recommended, based on the proper identification of hazards, allowing the\n          mitigation and control of risk; likewise developing a culture of self-care in\n          workers is recommended.</p>\n      </abstract>\n      <kwd-group xml:lang=\"en\">\n        <title>Keywords:</title>\n        <kwd>Occupational accident</kwd>\n        <kwd>basic causes</kwd>\n        <kwd>immediate causes</kwd>\n        <kwd>lack of control</kwd>\n        <kwd>personal factors</kwd>\n      </kwd-group>\n    </front-stub>\n    <body>\n      <sec sec-type=\"intro\">\n        <title>1. Introducción</title>\n        <p> The construction sector has a set of occupational hazards that are specific to\n          that activity, involving elevated work, excavation work, hoisting up materials,\n          the seasonal nature of their workplaces, and others; this means that the the\n          implentation of a management system for worker safety and health is applied\n          differently. It is important to note that the activities done on construction\n          sites are considered to be high risk and therefore may result in occupational\n          accidents.</p>\n        <p>Occupational accidents can result from immediate or basic causes; the immediate\n          causes directly produce the accident and are composed of unsafe acts\n          (inappropriate behavior of the workers that could result in a workplace\n          incident) and unsafe conditions (facilities, equipment, machinery and tools that\n          are faulty and that place the workers at risk of having an accident). But to\n          achieve an effective solution to occupational accidents, it is critical to\n          identify and control the basic causes which result in the immediate causes; they\n          include personal factors (incorrect work habits, incorrect use of equipment,\n          tools or facilities; physical or mental defects, hearing deficiencies, etc.) and\n          work factors (deficient supervision and leadership; unsuitable policies,\n          procedures, guides or practices; unsuitable work planning or scheduling) (<xref\n            ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">Chinchilla, 2002</xref>).</p>\n        <p>According to the statistics of the Worldwide Labor Organization (Organización\n          Internacional del Trabajo or OIT), in its report of the worldwide day for\n          occupational safety and health, “Approximately 4% of the worldwide Gross\n          National Product (GNP) is lost due to the costs of losses, deaths and illnesses,\n          resulting in work absences, treatments and payments due to disability or\n          death”.</p>\n        <p> The accidental pyramid theory developed by Bird in 1969 showed that for each\n          serious accident there are 10 less serious accidents, 30 accidents with property\n          damage and 600 accidents without visible damage or losses (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n            rid=\"B5\">Chinchilla, 2002</xref>). Likewise, refers to comparing the amount\n          of incidents that do not cause personal injuries with those that do result in\n          injuries; he also states that the implementation of a system to analyze the\n          incidents can be a key path to prevent or control occupational accidents.</p>\n        <p>On the other hand, mention that currently in industrial health and safety it is\n          common to use corresponding standards; however, these standards are often poorly\n          applied, generating difficulties in project development associated with risks;\n          if these risks aren’t evaluated, they can end up affecting the regular progress\n          of construction. The authors refer to delays in the construction project, the\n          economic losses and overcharges as the main problems derived from the lack of\n          risk planning in occupational safety and health. This research indicates that\n          the safety conditions of the construction site within the Colombian context are\n          deficient and therefore result in accidents that cause all types of injuries,\n          disabilites and death.</p>\n        <p><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">Buendía (2013)</xref> refers to the importance of\n          identifying the causes of the accidents at the construction site, emphasizing\n          that there must be a search for the true origen of all of the causes that set\n          off the incident. Likewise, states that risk evaluation is a process that is\n          focused on decisions being made about the type of preventive actions that should\n          be taken to minimize occupational risks.</p>\n        <p>Highlights that the construction industry is one of the highest risk occupational\n          activities, given the high incidence of the accidents shown which result in\n          human and material losses. Statistics are fundamental to identify the causes of\n          the accidents, to guide possible intervention plans as well as for the\n          effectiveness of those plans.</p>\n        <p> Affirm that for 2011 in Colombia, the construction sector had the highest\n          accident rate of 22.71%, of which 11% of the accidents were severe or fatal. In\n          Colombia during 2012, of the 532 deaths recorded in workplace accidents, 136 are\n          from the real estate sector, 125 from the construction sector; in the sectors of\n          transportation, storage and communications there were a total of 78 fatal\n          victims. This reflects that 44 people died each month due to occupational\n          accidents. These statistics are included in reports from 10 occupational risk\n          managers (Ministerio del Trabajo, 2013).</p>\n        <p>The Federation of Columbian Insurers, in one of their publications, indicate that\n          in 2013, every 11 and &#x00BD; hours a worker died due to an occupational\n          accident, and that there are an average of 62 occupational accidents per hour in\n          Colombia, or 1,487 cases per day. Therefore, they conclude that last year there\n          were 543,079 occupational accidents in the country.</p>\n        <p> This indicates the need to study the number of accidents in the construction\n          sector, and based on that study, to generate a detailed analysis of the causes\n          that generate those occupational accidents, allowing companies to adopt this\n          project as a foundation to implement measures for prevention and control of\n          accidents; state that a well organized job site is generally a job site that is\n          safe, planned, managed and controlled.</p>\n        <p>From the results of this research, it is important to value protection systems\n          relating to occupational health and psychological services. Therefore, this\n          article places importance on providing greater knowledge and communicating the\n          need that construction companies’ have for the implementation and tracking of a\n          safety and health system to be effective; this includes training, incentives and\n          simulations that represent the possible occupational risks so that they can then\n          be prevented. They also should incorporate evaluation protocol executive\n          functioning as part of personnel selection; this will allow them to have the\n          right people who will be able to reduce the rate of accidents at the job sites,\n          to improve working conditions and the welfare of collaborators, therefore to\n          improve the productivity of construction companies.</p>\n      </sec>\n      <sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\">\n        <title>2.

To conduct the analysis of the\n            causes of the occupational accidents that occured in the two construction\n            projects during the second semester of 2012, the units of study were the\n            Unique Forms for Occupational Accidents (FURAT in Spanish) (Ministry of\n            Social Protection 2005) that were issued by the occupational risk insurer\n            ARL. In this case, interviews with witnesses and injured individuals were\n            not conducted, nor was a study completed at the site of the accident, of the\n            tools and equipment involved, since the research was conducted after the\n            event had occured. To better understand the phenomenon of occupational\n            accidents, we should take into account the accident loss causation model\n            developed by Frank E.

Also we can see that various accidents identify various\n          immediate causesunsafe conditions.</p>\n        <p>In the review of the immediate causes, we found that accidents were mainly caused\n          by unsafe acts, representing 74%, which were caused by human error, with people\n          not following safety practices and procedures, and not being aware that they may\n          have an accident when they conduct those activities (<xref ref-type=\"fig\"\n            rid=\"f6\">Figure 3</xref>).</p>\n        <p>\n          <fig id=\"f6\">\n            <label>Figure 3</label>\n            <caption>\n              <title>Immediate causes that influence the accidents studied.

Discussion &amp; conclusions</title>\n        <p>According to the results from this research, we found that among the 117\n          occupational accidents analyzed, the hands and eyes were the most affected body\n          parts, with a total of 23 and 21 injuries respectively. In regards to hands,\n          this is due to the fact that they are the main part of the body involved in the\n          entire activity, specifically in the case of manufacturing as well as\n          construction; one of the main areas where occupational accidents were reported\n          to the ARL is construction at 10.46%. Likewise, the eyes were the second part of\n          the body that are most impacted due to the presence of foreign bodies present\n          during activities in this sector (Quintero, 2010). In reviewing the causes, the\n          research identified 195 instances of lack of control, where the most relevant\n          were the lack of analysis and work processes, planned work observations and\n          worker training; 248 basic causes included 136 for personal factors, and 112 due\n          to work factors; there were 205 immediate causes, of which 151 were due to\n          unsafe acts and 54 due to unsafe conditions.</p>\n        <p> Therefore we conclude that the occurence of occupational accidents have mainly\n          been caused by lack of controls, followed by unsafe acts; as defined by <xref\n            ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">Chinchilla (2002)</xref>, they are due to all types\n          of actions or omissions done by individuals that allow these accidents to occur.\n          The the age of workers is a relevant aspect since this research and other\n          authors coincide that young workers (from 18 to 35 years) are the ones that have\n          the most work accidents, due to the lack of experience, as well as the lack of\n          awareness of the dangers and risks present in their positions at work. The third\n          most important cause of the occupational accidents analyzed was due to personal\n          factors related to workers’ abilities (training, skill, aptitude, and others).\n          The main causal mechanisms of occupational accidents were falling objects (29%)\n          followed by being stepped on, crashes or blows (24%); similar results were found\n          by other authors (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">Cruz et al., 2009</xref>).</p>\n        <p>The lack of control of these activities causes greater exposure to risk; when\n          control measures or control barriers are not implemented, the worker is totally\n          exposed to the risks associated with the activity. Studies conducted by Slovic\n          et al., (1982) found that one of the attributes that was most closely related to\n          the size of the perceived risk was fear, which is evident in activites such as\n          not using individual protections, working in low-lit spaces, the use of faulty\n          electrical installations and exposure to gases and vapors; the size of the risk\n          is high together with the fear. This can be seen in daily situations where the\n          general population is exposed, whereas the activities that were the subject of\n          this research were specifically for workers in the construction sector, where\n          there are greater benefits for those who are exposed.</p>\n        <p>Another attribute that is mentioned in studies done by Slovic et al., (1982) is\n          the knowledge of those who are exposed; many studies have found that more risk\n          is perceived in activities that are considered to be the most common activities.\n          However in this study, the attributes known to those exposed had a high value of\n          awareness, whereas they assigned a low value of risk to activites including\n          exposure to noise, to dust, unkept worksites and handling of objects and tools.\n          According to the results obtained in this study, we see that when an activity\n          has immediate consequences, workers state that the perceived size of the risk is\n          highest, whereas when consequences are peceived to be delayed, the importance of\n          the damage perceived is lower. Therefore workiers would be referring to a\n          sensation of immediacy of consequences to determine the seriousness of damages,\n          with a degree of fear or rejection for those activities that they consider to be\n          more harmful to health and wellbeing, in line with finding from traditional\n          studies regarding risk perception (Fischhoff, 1984).</p>\n        <p>Comparing the results of this research to the results obtained by Fontaneda et\n          al., (2010), and <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">Consumer (2003)</xref>, Monday\n          is identified as one of the days when more occupational accidents happen; it\n          confirms that this has to do with the loss of daily momentum that workers have\n          with their operations, since when they are starting work after a weekend of rest\n          the human body takes some time to adjust to the movement at work and the dangers\n          that this carries. In addition, it is believed that alcohol consumption during\n          the weekend is common for the workers in this sector (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n            rid=\"B7\">Confederate Executive Commission of UGT, 2011</xref>) and this\n          activity means that the rest period, sleep and relaxation prior to returning to\n          work may have been interrupted, so that this may also contribute to accidents\n          occuring.</p>\n        <p>In this manner, it is critical to have the resources and continual planning by\n          the agents involved in this specific study, so that construction companies can\n          fully comply with the required activities of occupational safety and health.\n          With the results obtained in this research, we suggest that this sector should\n          implement a safety program; this program would have the objective of the\n          appropriate identification, awareness, evaluation and control of the different\n          dangers and risks that originate in the workplace so as to protect hands and\n          eyes, which are the parts of the body that are most impacted during these\n          activities. Likewise we suggest that workers be provided with the necessary\n          training and information so they can perform their functions in optimal safety\n          conditions; daily training regarding basic safety behaviors is critical for each\n          and every worker; and finally we suggest implementing programs of appreciation\n          and awareness of safety as an essential value, so as to contribute to reducing\n          unsafe actions which constantly occur during work on construction projects.</p>\n        <p>Likewise, we recommend that companies create and standardize the analysis and\n          work processes, particularly critical taks which can be identified with an\n          appropriate risk evaluation, which will allow them to be quanitified so as to\n          design managment programs that will support thier intevention and control. In\n          addition, as is indicated in the European Agency for Occupational Safety and\n          Health , management’s commitment is essential to establish clear policies\n          regarding health and safety, and so as to supply the necessary resources for its\n          implementation.</p>\n        <p>Planning is considered to be a fundamental step that every organization should\n          conduct to prevent occupational accidents; all essential information should be\n          collected in a clear and detailed document, so as to implement systematic,\n          coherent and effictive preventive actions, to confront the occupational risks\n          inherent in the company’s activities (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">Collado,\n            2008</xref>). Time and money expended in this activity are recouped by\n          obtaining effective and quick results; it is important to clarify that it is not\n          enough to simply put it on paper, but rather it must be implemented. For that\n          reason, supervising the appropriate implementation of this is key. The data\n          presented in this research shows the need to undertake the topic of safety and\n          health in the workplace in all of its dimensions and with the participation of\n          all of those involved in the organization (employers, occupational risk\n          administrators, contractors, workers and educational institutions); this way\n          they can offer a common approach with the goal of improving the quality of life\n          for workers in this sector, reducing workplace incidents.</p>\n        <p>Finally, it is very important to contine to deepen the expertise with future\n          research on the topic of individuals’ behavior and motiviation, because unsafe\n          acts are the main causes of accidents in those construction projects; these\n          accidents may be related to motivation since this is the force that moves a\n          person to do something, and it can come from an external stimulus such as the\n          environment, family problems, economic problems, problems coming from the mind\n          of the worker, etc. Therefore, a psychological study of the topic would help to\n          deepen the understanding of the basic causes related to personal factors and the\n          immediate cuases related to the unsafe acts of workers who work in the\n          construction sector. This sector is such an important contributor to the\n          country’s economy (Portafolio.co, 2013) but on a daily basis it presents a large\n          amount of latent dangers and risks that can affect the physical, mental and\n          social integrity of the collaborators.</p>\n      </sec>\n    </body>\n  </sub-article>\n</article>\n",
